        the university.</span></p>

        behaviors can be addressed at the department level, with a n</span><span >on-punitive outcome, before
        they potentially escalate to prohibited conduct. In particular, we discourage behaviors contributing to an
        atmosphere that detracts from the academic and educational mission of the department and the university. Such
        behaviors include the </span><span >following: </span></p>
