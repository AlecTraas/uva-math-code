    <TD>Thomas Hewitt Key <BR><BR>(1799-1875) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Thomas Hewitt Key was born in London on 20 March 1799. He was the youngest 
son of a London physician, and half-brother of Charles Aston Key, an eminent 
surgeon. Key was sent to the Rev. Samuel Dewe's School at Buntingford in 
Hertfordshire, where he remained for nearly ten years. From there, he went to 
St. John's College, Cambridge, but moved to Trinity College after obtaining a 
scholarship. He took his degree in 1821 and was nineteenth wrangler on the 
Mathematical Tripos. Key was initially inclined to study law but, in accordance 
with his father's wishes, he began to prepare for the medical profession. He 
studied for nearly two years at Guy's Hospital in London, but in the summer of 
1824, an agent from the State of Virginia came to England to choose four 
professors for the new University of Virginia and invited Key to accept the 
professorship of mathematics. (His relatively high score on the Tripos, was 
presumably viewed as sufficient to qualify him for the post.) Although Key had 
already opted to withdraw from the pursuit of science, he found, in his words, 
the "power to agree" to the University of Virginia's offer. </P>
<P>In Charlottesville, Key proved a great success as a teacher of mathematics. 
During the summer of 1825, moreover, he also taught ancient Greek and Latin, in 
the absence of the Professor of Ancient Languages. Key began the etymological 
study of the Latin language at this time that he would pursue until the end of 
his life. </P>
<P>Much to the dismay of the University community, Key left Charlottesville in 
1827 due, most likely to the harshness of the climate. He returned to London, 
where he was appointed Professor of Latin at the newly founded University of 
London in 1828. In 1833, he was appointed co-headmaster of the University 
College School, a preparatory school associated with University College. In 
1842, he gave up the professorship of Latin and took the professorship of 
comparative grammar, in addition to the headmastership. He held the latter 
position until his death in November 1875. </P>
<P>Key was also one of the founders of the London Library in St. James's Square 
and a member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, an 
organization devoted to the education of the general public. For some years, he 
was President of the Philological Society of London. </P>
<P>Key's literary labors were numerous. Under the auspices of the Society for 
the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, he made a map of ancient France (Gallia) 
accompanied by a one of the French provinces before 1789. He also wrote several 
articles for the Society's publications and contributed several articles, 
chiefly on language, to its Penny Cyclopaedia. In 1846, he published a Latin 
grammar text that long served the students of the University College School. 
Key's last work, on "Language, its Origin and Development," was published in 
1874. He left an unfinished Latin dictionary at the time of his death. </P>

    <TD>Charles Bonnycastle <BR><BR>(1796-1840) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The University of Virginia's second Professor of Mathematics, Charles 
Bonnycastle, was born in Woolwich, England on 22 November 1796. His father, 
John, was Professor of Mathematics at the Royal Military Academy there, and so 
Charles grew up and received his education in an environment that very much 
influenced his own subsequent career. The contributions that the son made to the 
thirteenth edition of his father's textbook, <EM>Introduction to Algebra</EM> 
(1824), in fact, augmented the credentials he presented to Francis Walker 
Gilmer, agent for the newly forming University of Virginia. </P>
<P>Bonnycastle actually came to the University at its opening in 1825 as the 
first professor, not of mathematics, but of natural philosophy (as physics was 
then called). When Thomas Key, the first Professor of Mathematics, resigned to 
return to his native England, Bonnycastle shifted over to the mathematical chair 
and remained in that post until his untimely death on 31 October 1840 at the age 
of only forty-three. "Old Bonny," as he was fondly called by the students, moved 
away from what was increasingly becoming the antiquated synthetic approach to 
mathematical pedagogy that had been so typical of Oxbridge mathematical teaching 
in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and introduced the more 
avant-garde analytic approach of late eighteenth-century French authors such as 
Silvestre Lacroix. In 1834, he published his own textbook, <EM>Inductive 
Geometry</EM>, in which he aimed to unite the best of the synthetic and the 
analytic approaches to geometry for the college- and university-level audience. 
Bonnycastle also contributed works on mathematical and physical topics to the 
<EM>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society</EM>, one of the few 
venues available in early nineteenth-century America for the publication of 
original work in the sciences. </P>
<P>The photograph here is after the portrait of Bonnycastle painted by James W. 
Ford. Bonnycastle is buried in the University Cemetery at the corner of 
McCormick and Alderman Roads. </P>

    <TD>James Joseph Sylvester <BR><BR>(1814-1897) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>James Joseph Sylvester was born on 3 September 1814 into a Jewish family in 
London. After his early study at boarding schools in Highgate and Islington, he 
entered the University of London, in its first term in operation in 1828. There, 
Augustus De Morgan led the mathematics program. After only five months, 
Sylvester's relatives withdrew him from the institution owing to his apparent 
immaturity for university life. Sylvester returned to college in 1831, this time 
at St. John's College, Cambridge. Although he attained the outstanding 
distinction of Second Wrangler on the Mathematical Tripos in 1837, he was barred 
from receiving his degree and from competing for a fellowship or a professorship 
at Cambridge. This resulted from his inability to subscribe to the Thirty-nine 
Articles of the Church of England, a requirement of all who presented themselves 
for degrees or for positions at Cambridge. (At Oxford, subscription was required 
before a student was even allowed to matriculate.) Sylvester did win the 
professorship of natural philosophy in 1838 at non-sectarian University College 
London. In 1841, he was awarded an M.A. from Trinity College, Dublin. </P>
<P>Dissatisfied with his teaching duties in the chair of natural philosophy, 
Sylvester left England for Charlottesville in 1841. In November of that year, he 
assumed the University's professorship of mathematics, a post left vacant at 
Charles Bonnycastle's death. Although anti-Semitic articles in Richmond 
newspapers preceded his arrival, Sylvester was greeted warmly by the University 
community [2]. His contentment at the university was short-lived, however. 
Unruly students in his courses and the faculty's unwillingness to exact the 
punishment demanded by Sylvester for one Mr. Ballard caused his resignation from 
the University, effective in March 1842. (Sylvester insisted upon expulsion and 
the faculty would only support a reprimand, given the recent history of student 
unrest on the Grounds.) "Such were the accidents that accompanied the avoidable 
loss to the University of Virginia of one of the most extraordinary 
mathematicians of modern times" [1, 77]. </P>
<P>After trying unsuccessfully to secure positions at Columbia, Harvard, and 
elsewhere in the United States, Sylvester returned to London eventually to 
became an actuary and secretary at Equity and Law Life Assurance Company for ten 
years beginning in 1845. During this period, he met Arthur Cayley, who would 
become a mathematical catalyst and lifelong friend. </P>
<P>By 1850, Sylvester had "exploded onto the mathematical scene, reaching new 
heights of productivity and creativity" [2, 66]. In 1850 and 1851, drawing from 
his prior work on determinants and on the theory of forms, he synthesized in a 
series of twenty papers his ideas and the results of others into what would 
later be recognized as invariant theory. He spent the rest of his actuarial 
career further developing this theory with Cayley. </P>
<P>Sylvester returned to academia in 1855, becoming Professor of Mathematics at 
the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich, England. Although his achievements were 
highly recognized by the mathematical community during his years at Woolwich, 
Sylvester did not find his duties at the Academy conducive to his research. 
"[H]e taught drudgerous mathematics to mostly uncaring students and fought with 
the military authorities over teaching loads destined, he was convinced, to 
bring the 'extinction of my scientific existence' " [4, 210]. In the late 1860s, 
the situation had gotten so dire that he wrote to Cayley that "I have done no 
mathematics--ever intending and ever putting it off. . . . If I thought it would 
do any good I would ask you to pray for my rescue from this enslaving indolence 
and paralysis of the will for such it amounts to" [3, 131-132]. </P>
<P>After being forced into an early retirement from the Academy in 1870, 
Sylvester spent six years adrift in London, occupying his time primarily by 
composing poetry. In 1876, however, his luck changed, and he crossed the 
Atlantic once more to establish the mathematics program at the newly opened 
Johns Hopkins University. His professorship there "marked the beginning of a 
quarter-century-long process of establishing mathematics at the research level 
in the United States" [4, 218] and reinvigorated his study of invariants. In 
particular, he crafted America's first true graduate program in mathematics, 
guided nine students in their doctoral research, and made major advances in 
invariant theory, combinatorics, and the theory of matrix algebras. </P>
<P>Seven years later, Sylvester traveled back to England to assume the Savilian 
Chair of Geometry at New College, Oxford, a position which, after the 1871 
repeal of the religious restrictions, was finally open to him. He tried to build 
a school of mathematical research at Oxford like the one he had animated at 
Hopkins, but his efforts were premature. As he put it in a letter to Hopkins 
President, Daniel Coit Gilman, in March of 1887: "It seems to me that 
Mathematical science here is doomed and must eventually fall off like a withered 
branch from a Tree which derives no nutriment from its roots" [3, 264]. </P>
<P>Failing health and eyesight caused Sylvester to step down officially from his 
chair in 1894. He died in London on 15 March 1897, one of England's 
nineteenth-century mathematical luminaries. </P>

<P>Edward Courtenay was born on 19 November 1803 in Baltimore, Maryland. His 
youth was distinguished by remarkably precocious academic performance. Entering 
the United States Military Academy in 1818 as the youngest cadet to enter since 
its founding in 1802, he graduated at the head of his class after only three 
years (the course usually took four). He was immediately appointed to a teaching 
post at his <EM>alma mater</EM>. During the next few years, he held a number of 
assistant professorial positions, before obtaining the professorship of natural 
and experimental philosophy in February 1829. While in this position, which 
primarily involved teaching applied mathematics to engineers, he published 
<EM>An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics</EM> (1833), a translation of a work in 
French by Jean-Louis Boucharlat. </P>
<P>In 1834, Courtenay was offered and accepted the chair of mathematics at the 
University of Pennsylvania. He held this post for two years before making a 
career change; he became a professional engineer. Working first for the New York 
and Erie Railroad, he next served as a civil engineer at Fort Independence in 
Boston Harbor between 1837 and 1841 and finally took over as chief engineer of 
the Dry Dock Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. After less than a year in the 
latter position, he re-entered academe, taking the chair of mathematics at the 
University of Virginia that Sylvester's hasty and unexpected departure had left 
vacant. </P>
<P>Courtenay's tenure at Virginia was, in contrast to that of his predecessor, a 
resounding success. He was described as a model professor: "He never by look, 
act, word, or emphasis disparaged the efforts or undervalued the acquirements of 
his pupils. His pleasant smile and kind voice, when he would say, 'Is that 
answer perfectly correct?' gave hope to many minds struggling with science" [1, 
vi-vii]. His premature death on 21 December 1853 thus came as a great shock to 
colleagues and students alike. </P>
<P>Courtenay left as his principal scientific legacy <EM>A Treatise on the 
Differential and Integral Calculus, and on the Calculus of Variations</EM> 
(1855), the manuscript of which was largely complete at the time of his death. 
This book ran to several editions over the next twenty years and was in its day 
the most comprehensive American work on the subject. The University acknowledged 
Courtenay's contributions by naming a dormitory in the Alderman Road complex in 
his honor. </P>

    <TD>Albert Taylor Bledsoe <BR><BR>(1809-1877) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>The epitome of an unreconstructed Southerner, Albert Bledsoe was born in 
Kentucky on 9 November 1809, the eldest son of Moses Ousley Bledsoe and Sophia 
Childress Taylor, a relation of Zachary Taylor. Bledsoe studied at the United 
States Military Academy, where he was a fellow student of Jefferson Davis and 
Robert E. Lee, and graduated in 1830. His first posting was as a lieutenant in 
the 7-th Infantry stationed along the western frontier. Resigning his post in 
1832, he headed east to study law, theology, and philosophy at Kenyon College in 
Ohio, where from 1833 to 1834 he held the posts of Professor of Mathematics and 
Instructor of French. In 1835, he became Professor of Mathematics at Miami 
University, but three years later, he moved to Springfield, Illinois to become a 
lawyer. While there, he practiced in the same courts as Abraham Lincoln and 
Stephen Douglas. </P>
<P>In 1848, Bledsoe was appointed Professor of Mathematics at the University of 
Mississippi, a chair he resigned in 1854 for the one left vacant at the 
University of Virginia by the death of Edward Courtenay. While at Virginia, he 
wrote "An Essay on Liberty and Slavery" (1856), in which he justified secession 
as a constitutional right and slavery as a moral right sanctioned by the Bible. 
At the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, he resigned his chair and joined the 
Confederate Army at the rank of colonel. Bledsoe was soon appointed Assistant 
Secretary of War by Jefferson Davis and so saw little action on the battlefield. 
He was sent to London for the purpose of researching various historical problems 
relating to the North-South conflict, as well as of guiding British public 
opinion in favor of the Confederate cause. </P>
<P>When he returned from Britain in February of 1865, the war was almost over. 
Nevertheless, the volume that resulted from his research, <EM>Is Davis a 
Traitor? Or Was Secession a Constitutional Right Previous to the War of 
1861?</EM> (1866), formed the basis of much of the case for the defense in 
Davis's trial immediately after the war. </P>
<P>In 1867, Bledsoe founded the <EM>Southern Review</EM>, serving as editor and 
dominant contributor for the next ten years. He thus spent the rest of his life 
engaged in the publication of articles and reviews in justification of the old, 
unreconstructed Southern attitudes. He dedicated the journal to "the despised, 
disenfranchised, and down-trodden people of the South" [1, 365]. As he said in 
an editorial on the question of abandoning the Southern cause, "[w]e would 
rather die" [1, 365]. This he did at Alexandria, Virginia on 8 December 1877.

    <TD>Charles Scott Venable <BR><BR>(1827-1900) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>Charles Scott Venable was born on 19 April 1827 in Prince Edward County, 
Virginia at Longwood, a home known for culture, hospitality, and wholesome 
outdoor life. His father, Nathaniel Venable, was one of the founders of 
Hampden-Sydney College, and from 1839 to 1845, Charles studied and then tutored 
there. In June of 1845, he began studies at the University of Virginia, but 
spent only one session here before taking a professorship of mathematics back at 
Hampden-Sydney. He stayed in that post for one year but was granted a leave of 
absence to return to the University of Virginia. During the 1847-1848 session, 
he resumed the work he had begun under the supervision of Edward Courtenay in 
mathematics, in addition to studying chemistry, natural philosophy, and modern 
languages. He returned to his Hampden-Sydney professorship in the fall of 1848. 
Four years later, he was given a second leave of absence to further his studies 
in Germany. He attended the lectures of the great astronomer, Johann Franz 
Encke, in Berlin, and Friedrich Argelander in Bonn as well as those of the 
brilliant young analyst, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and of the physicist, 
Heinrich Wilhelm Dove. </P>
<P>After returning to the U.S. in December of 1853, Venable held successive 
professorships at Hampden-Sydney, the University of Georgia, and the University 
of South Carolina. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he promptly volunteered and 
served from the bombardment of Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. The 
close of the Civil War saw Venable's return to his real life's work. </P>
<P>In 1865 he was invited to fill the chair of mathematics at the University of 
Virginia that he held for the remainder of his active life. He was elected Chair 
of the Faculty for the years 1870-1873 and 1886-1888. As a teacher, he possessed 
an instinctive comprehension of the individual needs of his students, and he 
made the School of Mathematics one of the largest and most highly respected in 
the University. </P>
<P>As a part of the post-war endeavor to provide textbooks for use in the South, 
Venable prepared a number of texts in mathematics. He compiled a complete series 
of treatises in pure mathematics that covered the full range of his University 
coursework. This series included: <EM>First Lessons in Numbers--A Primary 
Arithmetic: Combining Mental and Slate Exercises</EM> (1870); <EM>Higher 
Arithmetic for Advanced Students</EM> (1871); <EM>An Elementary Algebra</EM> . . 
. (1872); <EM>Teacher's Manual of Venable's New Practical Arithmetic</EM> . . . 
(1892); <EM>A Key Containing Solutions of the More Difficult Examples in 
Venable's Practical and Mental Arithmetic</EM> (1893); <EM>Mental Arithmetic 
Containing Oral Exercises in Abstract and Commercial Arithmetic</EM> (1894); 
<EM>An Easy Algebra for Beginners; Being a Simple, Plain Presentation of the 
Essentials of Elementary Algebra</EM> . . . (1895); <EM>Elementary 
Arithmetic</EM> (1896); <EM>Practical Arithmetic</EM> (1902); and <EM>High 
School Algebra</EM> . . . (1904). He also published a translation and adaptation 
of Legendre's Elements of Geometry (1910). In addition to the long series of 
mathematical textbooks, he published a number of articles, among them, "An 
Address Delivered before the Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia . . 
. July 26, 1858" (1859); "The Campaign from the Wilderness to Petersburg. 
Address . . . before the Virginia Division of the Army of Northern Virginia . . 
. Oct. 30, 1873" (1879); and "Report of Prof. C. S. Venable on the Total Eclipse 
of July 18, 1860 in Report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey . . . 1860" 
(1861). </P>

made Professor Emeritus. He died on 11 August 1900. </P>

<P>William Holding Echols was born 2 December 1859 in San Antonio, Texas. He 
received early private school educational training from the University of the 
South (in Sewanee, Tennessee) and the Episcopal High School of Virginia (in 
Alexandria). He earned both a Bachelor of Science and a civil engineering degree 
from the University of Virginia in 1882. After serving as an engineer for 
several railroad and mining companies, Echols accepted an engineering 
professorship, and later the directorship, at the Missouri School of Mines. He 
married Mary Elizabeth Blakey in September 1885, and they had five children 
before her death in 1894. </P>
<P>In 1891, Echols moved to Charlottesville to become an Adjunct Professor of 
Mathematics at the University. Besides introducing mechanical engineering to the 
University's curriculum, Echols served as the buildings and grounds supervisor. 
He aptly filled the latter role during the Rotunda fire of 1895. Armed with 
dynamite, Echols twice tried to separate the Rotunda from the burning Annex. 
After his attempt from the ground failed, he climbed to the top of the dome. He 
threw his explosives into the fire, causing an explosion heard fifteen miles 
away! Although the plan was not successful, the people of Charlottesville 
applauded the effort. He became a Full Professor of Mathematics in 1895. Two 
years later, he married Elizabeth Mitchell Harrison, with whom he also had five 
children. </P>
<P>In mathematics, Echols wrote <EM>Elementary Textbook on the Differential and 
Integral Calculus</EM> (1902). For the University community, he composed and 
delivered lectures on "The Infinite Mystery" (1912), "Truth" (1913), and "The 
Eleventh Commandment" (1914), all of which concerned philosophical issues and 
the Honor Code. </P>
<P>Echols, nicknamed "Reddy" on account of his red hair, became a fixture in the 
University. He gave the annual address on the honor system to the first year 
students and was active in Eli Banana, the first of the University's social 
organizations known as "ribbon" societies. Echols died of a heart attack on 25 
September 1934 at his home on the East Lawn. </P>
<P>In 1960, the University's Echols Scholars Program was begun in his name. He 
is buried in the University Cemetery, behind Echols House, a McCormick Road 
residence hall. </P>

    <TD>James Morris Page <BR><BR>(1864-1936) </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P>James Page was born in Cobham, Albemarle County, Virginia on 4 March 1864. 
His father, Thomas Walker Page, and his mother, Nancy Watson Morris, were both 
members of the "First Families of Virginia." Page's ancestor, Colonel John Page, 
for example, came to Virginia in 1650 and subsequently served as a member of His 
Majesty's Council in the colony. After home-schooling from his father, James 
earned his Master's degree at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland in 1885. By 
1887, he had traveled to the University of Leipzig and had completed a doctoral 
dissertation on the theory of transformation groups in four-space under the 
direction of the noted Norwegian mathematician, Sophus Lie. </P>
<P>At this point in the history of American mathematics, it was usual for 
students desirous of advanced training in mathematics to travel abroad since the 
United States could offer no comparable training following Sylvester's departure 
from The Johns Hopkins University in 1883. What was much less usual, however, 
was the fact that Page was able to complete his Leipzig dissertation in only two 
years. In his written assessment of Page's thesis, Lie stated categorically that 
the "work deals with and resolves an important and rather difficult problem in 
the theory of continuous transformation groups," a theory that Lie was still in 
the process of developing [2, 236]. While he also acknowledged that Page "was 
largely shown a way that offered good prospects for success," Lie felt that "the 
task of carrying the entire investigation through required not only considerable 
energy but also a significant amount of finesse in dealing with the 
computational techniques" and that "[t]he work must therefore be regarded as a 
true scientific accomplishment" [2, 236]. Lie was not known for showering faint 
praise. He thus clearly viewed Page's work as a valuable, original research 
contribution. Page published his research as "On the Primitive Groups of 
Transformations in Space of Four Dimensions" in the <EM>American Journal of 
Mathematics</EM> in 1888. </P>
<P>Page returned to Virginia, doctorate in hand, and held the headmastership of 
the Keswick School, a local private school, from 1888 to 1895. He had already 
begun his association with the University of Virginia by 1893, however, 
reporting in the <EM>Bulletin of the New York Mathematical Society</EM> that he 
was President of its Mathematical Club [1]. The year 1895-1896 found Page back 
in Europe--in Leipzig and Paris--working on the final touches of what would be 
his 1897 book, <EM>Ordinary Differential Equations: An Elementary Text Book with 
an Introduction to Lie's Theory of the Group of One Parameter</EM>. This book 
was one of the first texts in English aimed at providing an entree into Lie's 
notoriously complicated theory. </P>
<P>Page returned to the United States early in 1896 and lectured on his work as 
a Fellow by Courtesy, that is, what would today be termed a "visitor," at The 
Johns Hopkins University. Also in 1896, he became an associate editor of the 
<EM>Annals of Mathematics</EM> when its founder-editor, the University of 
Virginia astronomer, Ormond Stone, relinquished the editorship. At this time, 
Page was also appointed Adjunct Professor of Mathematics at Virgina. By the time 
the <EM>Annals</EM> moved to Harvard in 1899 and Page stepped down as associate 
editor, he had already served one year as an Associate Professor in the Virginia 
department, a promotion that had no doubt resulted from the publication of his 
book manuscript. On 26 July 1900, Page married Elinore Mildred McGlone; their 
son, James Morris Page, Jr., was born on 18 July 1901. Also in 1901, Page became 
Professor of Mathematics, the post he held until his retirement in 1934. </P>
<P>During his tenure at the University, Page became very active both in 
University governance and in general educational issues. He served as Dean of 
the Faculty from 1900 to 1902, as Chair of the Faculty from 1903 to 1904, and as 
a member of the State Board of Education of Virginia from 1910 to 1927. Page 
died in 1936. A dormitory in the McCormick Road complex is named in his honor.
