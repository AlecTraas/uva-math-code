# Mathematics at the University of Virginia

Official website of Department of Mathematics at the University of Virginia (under construction: see the current website [here](http://www.math.virginia.edu/))

## Notes on progress and ToDos

- Two main sources of updates - google calendars of seminars, plus in-site posts for news and other things
- For now I have coded the most difficult part - retrieving data from google calendars
- The posts feature is straightforward. I will use "categories" everywhere
- The sources of other less frequently updated information will be "seminars" and "people" in \_data and maybe other database-like structures (but not for courses I hope!.. but one can mine courses from Lou's list eventually :))
- Pages which are the most static will be just coded as html's with layouts. Hopefully there will not be many of them, and we'll need to assign some responsibility for those..
- There will be several layouts: main page (with special navbar?), posts page, and other pages with usual navbar; and the layouts will differ by the presence of the right-pane links!
- Need to figure out how to generate nice navbar with highlighting of the active page
- Need to figure out navbar conventions, too

## Conventions and adding content
