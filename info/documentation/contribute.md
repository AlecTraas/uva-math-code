# How you can contribute to updating the content at the Math Department website

---

## Overview: why?

The structure of the Math Department website
allows everyone to contribute to updating its contents.
Here are several examples:

1. Every member of the Department can update own personal information, such as
research interests, selected publications, link to personal page, etc. See [here]({{site.url}}/doc/people/) for details.

2. One can add news about conferences or seminar series being organized, and it will be displayed on the Department main page.
See [here]({{site.url}}/doc/news/) for details.

3. The website contains lots of information that should be kept up-to-date, including
undergraduate and graduate policies, etc. This can be updated by people in charge of these subjects.
See [here]({{site.url}}/doc/ugg/) for details.

4. Dedicated static pages can be created within the website, for example,
to host tutoring center information, etc. In this case, person(s) in charge would need to keep the information
up to date. This brings an advantage of uniform style of all official pages, and also version control.

Surely one can think of more examples and reasons why multiple people should edit the content on the website.
Below we discuss several ways one can interact with the website. All of them (except the number zero one)
require signing up at [GitHub](https://www.github.com) but this is quite simple.

## 0. Good old email or personal conversation

You can send an email to
{% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="lap5r" %}, {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="hcg3m" %}, or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="raj3e" %}, or talk to one of them, and explain what needs to be updated. This way of communication is **by no means not discouraged**, as the head goal is that the website
contains up-to-date and relevant information.

## 1. GitHub issues

Having a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account, one can add an **issue**. Current issues for the website are
located here: [`https://github.com/uva-math/uva-math-code/issues`](https://github.com/uva-math/uva-math-code/issues)
and a new issue can be added by anyone. **Issues are public** (but after all we're talking about editing a public website, right?).

The advantage of issues is that they can easily reference code, can be discussed and commented on, and ultimately be resolved and closed
(though closed issues also stay public). To view the source code for any page click on the
GitHub icon <a {% if paginator.page %}href="https://github.com/uva-math/uva-math-code/blob/master/allnews/index.html"
{% else %}href="https://github.com/uva-math/uva-math-code/blob/master/{{page.path}}"{% endif %} title="Contribute to the website's content on GitHub" target="_blank"><span class="fa fa-github-square fa-2x"></span></a> in the lower right corner. Then there is a link to 
issues on top of the resulting GitHub page.
