\title{Hypoelliptic diffusions and heat kernels on Lie groups}
\abstract{\small
Hypoelliptic diffusions are an interesting
			class of stochastic processes where, in
			spite of having a degenerate elliptic
			generator, the process is still able to
			wander throughout its state space.  Many
			familiar facts about elliptic partial
			differential operators such as the Laplacian
			have analogues in the hypoelliptic setting.
			In this talk, I will discuss some of the
			basic ideas connected with hypoelliptic
			diffusions, including some notions of
			sub-Riemannian geometry, as well as some
			results regarding heat kernel estimates on
			a specific class of Lie groups.
