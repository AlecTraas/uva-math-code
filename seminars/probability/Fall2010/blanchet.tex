\title{Steady-state simulation of stochastic fluid networks with L\'evy input}
\abstract{\small
Reflected stochastic networks arise in the
			analysis of a large class of queueing
			systems. The most popular model of this
			type is perhaps reflected Brownian motion,
			which arises in the heavy-traffic analysis
			of generalized Jackson networks. In this
			talk we discuss Monte Carlo simulation
			strategies for the steady-state analysis
			of reflected stochastic networks. In
			particular, we show how to exactly simulate
			a reflected stochastic network with compound
			Poisson input and how to provide samples
			that are close (with explicit and controlled
			error bounds) to both the transient and the
			steady-state distribution of reflected
			Brownian motion in the positive orthant.
