\title{Large-scale measurement of human behavior}
\abstract{\small
With the increasing availability of network and behavioral data---from
what we buy, to where we travel, to whom we know---we are now able
to observe and quantify social processes to a degree that would
have seemed impossible just a decade ago. These new microscopes
into human activity not only have substantive implications for
economics, sociology, and psychology, but also raise challenging
computational questions in large-scale data analysis. In this talk
I'll present several illustrative examples from this emerging
discipline of computational social science.   }
