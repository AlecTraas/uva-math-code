       A combinatorial generalisation of Cramers rule

Abstract:
          We review a result of G.X. Viennot, Lecture Notes in
Mathematics #1234, and comment on its significance for statistical mechanics:
a ratio of generating functions for disjoint oriented loops in a finite 
graph can be expressed in terms of the generating function of a single
path in the graph weighted according to loops in the path.  The result is
a generalisation of Cramer's formula for the inverse of a matrix.
