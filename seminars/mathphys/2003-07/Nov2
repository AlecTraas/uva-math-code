"On the Bargmann Transform and Regularization of the Kepler problem in
dimensions n=2,3,5."

Abstract:

In this talk we will introduce a Bargmann Transform (BT) for the Hilbert
space of square integrable functions defined on the n-sphere with n=2,3,5.
This BT is regarded as the quantization of a canonical transformation
which relates two different ways to regularize the Kepler problem in
dimensions n=2,3,5. We will also describe coherent states for the hydrogen
atom problem determined by the BT.
