Su Suwanna will speak on
     Finite Trotter approximation to the mean square distance in the 
Anderson Model.

We consider the Anderson model on $Z^d$ with i.i.d potentials. We show
that the finite Trotter approximation to the mean square distance
exhibits a diffusive behavior in dimensions $d\geq 3$ when the Fourier
transform of the common probability is $L^2(R)$.
