    "On the Schrodinger operator for a special wire loop configuration"

    We continue discussion concerning the Schrodinger operator 
    H= -d^2/ds^2+k^2(s), with the potential k^2(s) the square of the
    curvature  k(s) along a loop of length 2\pi.  Again, we consider the
    conjecture that H\geq 1.  We show this is so for wire configurations
    close to a particular family of singular "squashed" loops.  An 
    integrable Schrodinger operator arises, diagonalized by Gegenbauer
    polynomials.
