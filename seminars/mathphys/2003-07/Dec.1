George Hagedorn, Molecular Quantum Mechanics: A Review of the Standard
Born-Oppenheimer Theory and Modifications Concerning Hydrogen Bonding
 December 1, 3:30 Kerchof 317.

Abstract: We review mathematical results for the Time-Independent
Born-Oppenheimer Approximation that provides almost all that is known
about molecular quantum mechanics. We then present some recent
work with Alain Joye that is the first step in a program to obtain
better models for the vibrational structure of molecules that contain
Hydrogen bonds. We illustrate our technique with calculations for the
Bifluoride anion FHF-.
