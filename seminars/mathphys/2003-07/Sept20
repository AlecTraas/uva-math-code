David Hasler will speak on
     On Absence of groundstates for translation invariant
Pauli-Fierz models

Pauli-Firz models are non-relativistic models for an "atom" interacting with
a radiation field. The atom, in isolation, has a ground state. Depending
on the radiation field and its interaction with the atom, the system, may or 
may not have a ground state.
