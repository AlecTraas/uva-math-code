"Born-Infeld theory and the hydrogen atom"

Abstract:  With the aim of developing a theory of electromagnetism
which does not predict infinite self-energies, Born and Infeld proposed
non-linear field equations depending on a constant beta.  This was
recently quantized by M. K-H. Kiessling.  For the (approximate) hydrogen
atom the quantized equations lead to a Schroedinger equation with bounded
potential.  We analyze this new potential and the resulting ground state
energy.  Our results allow us to draw conclusions about beta.
