Gianluca Guadagni, A non-perturbative renormalization of the lattice \phi^4
model in dim>4 (cont.).

Abstract:

The RG method for a \phi^4-perturbed Gaussian measure is represented
as the evolution of integrands under convolution and rescaling.  The
integrands have a polymer representation which is encoded in a triple
(\lambda,\mu,R), so that the convolution wrt Gaussian measures with
finite range covariances and the rescaling make the RG an autonomous
map from (\lambda,\mu,R) to (\lambda',\mu',R').  For dim>4 and small
initial values of parameters \lambda, \mu, and R, it will be shown
that the map is contractive.
