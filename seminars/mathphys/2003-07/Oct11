Yao Wang will speak 
       On the invariant measure for a linear stochastic wave
  equation system.

The system arises as a model for non-equlibrium steady-state heat
flow.  Estimates for eigenvalues and projections for the associated
deterministic semigroup will be discussed.  The estimates imply
existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure.
