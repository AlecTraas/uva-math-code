   "Existence of the $D0$-$D4$ Brane Bound State: a Deformation Proof, continued"

Abstract:

After giving a short introduction to supersymmetric quantum mechanics,
we will consider the quantum mechanical system which is obtained by
dimensionally reducing $d=6$, $N=1$ supersymmetric gauge theory with
gauge group $U(1)$ and a single charged hypermultiplet.  This system
describes the low energy dynamics of a $D0$-brane in the presence of a
$D4$-brane. Using a deformation method and ideas introduced in the
physics literature, we present a proof of the existence of a
normalizable ground state for this system.
