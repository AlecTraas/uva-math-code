Abstract: "We will investigate how a long range magnetic perturbation
can affect the nature and location of the spectrum of a Schroedinger
type operator. Three physical applications will be presented in a
mathematically precise way: the quantum Hall effect, the Faraday
rotation, and the semiconductor magnetic stability."
