Title:  Asymptotic Completeness for Compton Scattering

Abstract:

An analysis of scattering in a model of a massive quantum-mechanical particle, an ``electron'',
interacting with massless, relativistic bosons, ``photons'', is presented. The
interaction term in the Hamiltonian describes emission and
absorption of ``photons'' by the ``electron''; but ``electron'' pair production
is suppressed. An ultraviolet cutoff and an (arbitrarily small, but fixed)
infrared cutoff are imposed on the interaction term. In a range of energies
where the propagation speed of the dressed ``electron'' is strictly smaller than
the speed of light, unitarity of the scattering matrix is proven, provided the
coupling constant is small enough; (asymptotic completeness of Compton
scattering).

Joint work with J. Froehlich and B. Schlein.
