Invariant measure for a stochastic Ginsburg-Landau equation 

I would like to discuss some work of Eckmann and Hairer, and other work on
invariant measures for certain PDE's.  I will review some aspects of
Malliavin's approach to Hormander's theorem on hypoellipticity and how
it i generalized to an infinite dimensional setting.
