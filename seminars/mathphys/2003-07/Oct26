"Sample field properties of a one-dimensional linear field in a thermal
  non-equilibrium state"

We consider the stationary state for a one-dimensional linear wave
equation, with dissipation and with low-dimensional random driving
terms modeling thermal baths (at different temperatures).  The goal is
to show that typical field configurations are (Holder) continuous.

This talk will first review methods (Garsia, Rademich, and Runsey) for
showing continuity of sample configurations for a random field.
