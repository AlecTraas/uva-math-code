Title: Ergodicity for some (stochastic) differential equations; work
of M. Hairer.  


Abstract:

       I'll review a paper of M. Hairer, (London Math Soc. 2005)  His results
are applicable to ergodicity questions and uniqueness of invariant states
for some stochastic differential equations modelling heat flow
problems, and to ergodicity questions in fluid mechanics.
