        "Topological quantum computation"

This model of quantum computation was proposed by Freedman and Kitaev
several years ago. One of the main advantages of this approach,
compared to the "classical" qubit model is a "built in" error
correction. I will talk about about trying to find a quantum mechanical
system whose ground state is a TQFT.
