Title: A connecting heteroclinic orbit for the renormalization group I:
overview

Kerchof Hall 317, 3:30, Wednesday, Nov.14

Abstract:

This is the first of a series of talks on our recent construction of a
complete renormalization group trajectory connecting a Gaussian
ultraviolet fixed point to a nontrivial infrared fixed point. We will
give a general overview of the renormalization group as a mathematical
tool for the study of functional integrals, of the particular scalar
field model we consider and of our main result. We will also provide
an introduction to the Brydges et al.  rigorous theory of the
renormalization group dynamical system.
