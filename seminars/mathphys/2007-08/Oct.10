Title: Segal-Bargmann Analysis using Dunkl Operators


Kerchof 317, 3:30, Wednesday Oct. 10.

Abstract: This talk is a generalization of previous work of mine and
various collaborators from dimension one to finite dimensions, using
the Dunkl operators in R^n.  We establish the role of dilations using
the quantum deformation parameter (Planck's constant), and relations
with the heat kernel of the Dunkl theory, thereby generalizing results
of Hall and our own earlier work.  Some open problems will also be discussed.
