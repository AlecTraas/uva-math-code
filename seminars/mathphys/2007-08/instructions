In order to schedule a speaker for the Mathematical Physics
Seminar, check the URL for the week you wish to schedule.  If there is
nothing scheduled, go ahead and set aside the slot for your speaker by
adding information to the corresponding file.  It would also be
helpful to change the file 

/home/let/public_html/Mathphys/index.html

and change the words "No seminar scheduled" to the name of your speaker.  A link to the speaker's home page is helpful if this is known.

To make these changes you have to be using an editor on weyl.

Title, and any further information on the talk would be appreciated
when available.  The usual time for the seminar is 2:00 Wednesdays,
but exceptions can of course be made to accomodate schedules.  

The file you'd need to modify for Sep29, for example, is

/home/let/public_html/Mathphys/Sep29

If you have trouble modifying the file you can email me with the information at let@virginia.edu
