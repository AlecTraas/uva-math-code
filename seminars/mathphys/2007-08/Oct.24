Title: Regularity of the Green Function for a vector valued Anderson System

Kerchof 317, 3:30, Wednesday Oct. 24.

Abstract:

We will decribe a renormalization type procedure that ensures the almost sure
regularity of the matrix elements of the resolvent (aka Green function) for a
random spin Hamiltonian with a disorder generated by a random magnetic
field. This is a joint result with G.-M. Graf.
