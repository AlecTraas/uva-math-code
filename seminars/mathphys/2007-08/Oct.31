Title:  Existence and uniqueness for invariant measure
for a stochastic system with ultra-violet cutoff

Kerchof 317, 3:30, Wednesday Oct. 31.

Abstract:

We consider the problem of existence and uniqueness for the invariant
measure of a stochastic wave equation.  The invariant measure is to model
steady state but nonequilibrium heat flow.

We will review important estimates on the covariance of the field for 
the linear wave equation case.  We will also show the existence and
uniqueness for a non-linear system with ultra-violet cutoff. We will
note a uniform bound on the variance of given Fourier modes of the field as
the ultra-violet cutoff is removed.
