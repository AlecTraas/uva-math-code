Title: Lifetimes of quasi-stationary states in non-relativistic QED

Kerchof 317, 3:30, Wednesday September 26, and
Wednesday, Oct. 3.

Abstract:We consider resonances in a model of non relativistic quantum
mechanical matter coupled to the photon field. We prove upper and
lower bounds on the lifetimes of quasi-stationary states, and show how
these lifetimes can be calculated.
