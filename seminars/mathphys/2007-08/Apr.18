Title: On Open Scattering Channels for Manifolds with Ends

Abstract.

  We discuss the interaction of channels in geometric
scattering theory where the dynamics is given by the Laplacian on a
complete Riemannian manifold M with a finite number of ends. We
establish the following stability theorem: suppose that j-th
scattering channel is open in the sense that waves coming in from 
infinity in this channel are not totally reflected; then the same
property holds for small perturbations of the metric.  The conditions
on the size of the perturbation are expressed in terms of the harmonic
radius r(x) at a point x in M, as defined by Anderson and Cheeger.  We
present simple examples like rotationally symmetric manifolds and 
double coverings of the plane.  (Joint work with r. Weder (Mexico 
City) and O. Post (Berlin)).
