          Cases of Equality for the Gaussian Isoperimetric 
                   and Rearrangement Inequalities

ABSTRACT: 
We determine all the cases of equality in a recent inequality due to 
S. Bobkov.  Since the isoperimetric inequality for  R^n  equipped 
with Gaussian measure is a consequence of Bobkov's inequality, the result 
supplies the cases of equality for this isoperimetrc inequality as well.  

As in the more familiar setting of  R^n  with Lebesgue measure, the 
`sharp' form of the isoperimetric inequality on Gauss space gives rise 
to a `sharp' rearrangement inequality for functionals which involve an 
energy arising from a gradient.  A typical example is an energy of 
the form 
                \int |grad u|^2 d\gamma , 

where  \gamma  is the Gaussian measure on  R^n .
