"Critical percolation in the plane: 
Scaling limits, conformal invariance, and SLE_6"

Schramm's SLE_k processes describe random curves in the
plane governed by conformally invariant laws. I will
describe their construction, and explain why these are 
canonical candidates for scaling limits of certain
stochastic lattice systems, including critical percolation,
random spanning trees, and loop-erased walks. Time 
permitting, I will comment on Smirnov's proof that SLE_6
is indeed the scaling limit for a particular model
of critical percolation.
