The one-dimensional hard-core gas and three-dimensional branched polymers

Last time I used an identity between the pressure of the D dimensional hard-core
gas and the generating function of branched polymers in D+2 dimensions to determine
the scaling behavior of three-dimensional branched polymers.  Now I will explain this
beautiful "dimensional reduction" formula.
