Title: The geometric and algebraic foundations of conformal field theory

Abstract:  Conformal field theory (or more specifically, string theory) and
related superconformal field theories are the most promising attempts at
developing a physical theory that combines all fundamental interactions of
particles, including gravity. The geometry of this theory extends the model
of point particles whose propagation in time sweeps out a line in
space-time, to one-dimensional ``particles'' (strings) whose propagation in
time sweeps out a two-dimensional surface.  For two-dimensional genus-zero
holomorphic conformal field theory, string interactions can be described
algebraically by vertex operator algebras (VOAs).  Independently from the
physical theory of conformal fields, VOAs arose naturally from the study of
representations of  infinite-dimensional Lie algebras and in the
construction of representations of the Monster finite simple group. In
addition, this work uncovered a surprising connection between VOAs
and number theory.
     The crucial step of obtaining a rigorous correspondence between the
algebraic setting described above and the geometric setting of conformal
field theory was achieved by Huang in 1990 and the corresponding rigorous
foundation for N=1 superconformal field theory was achieved by Barron in
1996.  In addition to being a necessary step towards constructing and
understanding full conformal field theory, this work has recently led to
results in general Lie theory, the construction of new conformal field
theories via twisted sectors, and an understanding of N=2 superconformal
field theory as a continuous
deformation of N=1 theory.
