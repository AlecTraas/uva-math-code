Shape Optimization, Shells, and Applications

Abstract:

In many industrial processes the performance of the system highly depends
on the geometric configuration, because of different physical phenomena.

Given a PDE defined in a bounded domain, one is interested to know what is 
the perturbation of the solution of that PDE under small perturbations of 
the domain.  The shape derivative turns out to be an interesting tool for
this.  We shall recall the the basic methods concerning the shape derivative
and also explain why the situation is more complicated in the hyperbolic
case and how we can recover some results by using the hidden regularity.

A great increase in the development of flexible structures has taken
place within the space and aeronautic industries during the last
decade, with the emergence of micro-satellites.  In response to their 
specific constraints, the engineers have proposed a concept known as 
passive control.  We shall apply the shape optimization techniques
described previously to one example: the Carpentier's joint, which is
a shell with some geometric properties.

There are parts of this work that joint with Jean-Paul Zolesio (CNRS, France)
and parts with Jean-Paul Marmorat (Ecole des Mines de Paris, France).
