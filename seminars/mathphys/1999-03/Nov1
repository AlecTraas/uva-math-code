           "Rigorous Branch Classification for the 
           Spectrum of the Orr-Sommerfeld Equation 
               for Plane Couette Flow"

Abstract:
The spectrum of the Orr-Sommerfeld equation for Plane Couette Flow
(solution continuum of the characteristic equation) undergoes only
remarkably simple topological changes as the Reynolds number 
changes from zero to infinity. 

The comparatively simple case of Reynolds number 0 determines most of 
the structure for any finite Reynolds number, but not for infinite 
Reynolds number; the only complementary phenomenon is the so-called 
mode crossing.
