"Strong-Coupling Problems in Quantum Mechanics" (cont.)
3:30, Monday November 4.

The talk is concerned with the problem of a quantum particle interacting with 
a quantized "phonon".  Of particular interest is the situation in which the
coupling constant of the Hamiltonian interaction term is taken large.
