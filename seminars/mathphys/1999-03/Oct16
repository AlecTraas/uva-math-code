Alex Jimenez-Maza 
"Holonomic Constraints"
3:30, Monday October 14.

The talk is concerned with classical Hamiltonian systems with magnetic
fields and a strong potential forcing the system onto a sub-manifold
in phase space.  It is a continuation of his first talk, Sept. 30.  A
specific example of a constrained system is to be considered.
