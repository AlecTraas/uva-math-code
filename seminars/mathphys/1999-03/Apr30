"From Atomic Physics to Semi-classical Analysis"

ABSTRACT: 
We review some classical results and recent developments in the 
mathematical theory of atoms. Starting with the question of the stability 
of an atom we discuss some properties of the periodic table of elements, 
such as the size and the ground state energy of an atom as a function of 
the nuclear charge. This leads to standard semi-classical eigenvalue 
problems for Schroedinger operators, for which we introduce a new coherent 
states' calculus. This is part of a joint work with J.P. Solovej."
