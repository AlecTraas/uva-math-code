           "Some formulas surrounding 
         non-Hermitian matrix ensembles"

ABSTRACT:
The last few years have witnessed  remarkable progress in 
Random Matrix Theory (RMT),  generally due  to techniques 
from  Integrable Systems.  These recent  results  largely 
concern ensembles of Hermitian matrices as many important 
early  models  to which RMT  was applied  possessed  that 
symmetry.  On the other hand, among the physics community 
there  has been  growing  interest  in the  non-Hermitian 
case.  The purpose  of this talk is  to describe  various 
considerations for non-Hermitian random matrices  and why 
(happily)   certain  results  come  easier  than  in  the 
Hermitian case.
