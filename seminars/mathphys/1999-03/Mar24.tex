Let $P$ be a
differential operator  and  let  $V$ and  $W$ be measurable functions.

We consider   sufficiently regular functions $u$  which satisfy
\[  |Pu|    \le     V |u| + W |\nabla u | \]
in a ball. We say the triple $(P,V,W)$ has the  strong unique continua
tion property (SUCP)
if u vanishes if it vanishes of infinite order at one point.

\bigskip

{\bf
Theorem} (Koch, Tataru): Let $n > 2$ and let $P$ be an elliptic partia
l differential operator
of second order with Lipschitz continuous coefficients.
The triple $(P,V,W)$ has the SUCP
if $V  \in L^{n/2}$  and $W \in L^{n+\epsilon}$.

\bigskip

The talk explains this result. It will  give a sketch of the proof
and explains its relation to questions occuring in the context of
nonlinear dispersive equations.



\noindent The talk is based  on  joint work with D. Tataru.
