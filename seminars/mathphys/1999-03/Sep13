Title: Bootstrap percolation of convex defects

What is the effect of punching holes at random in an infinite&nbsp;
tensed membrane? When will the membrane still support tension? When will
there be floppy portions that bend and flex? When will the&nbsp; whole
structure become floppy with tension vanishing throughout the whole
membrane? 

We outline a mathematical theory of tension based
on graph rigidity theory and introduce a probabilistic model for
this problem. Assuming our infinite membrane is made of a material 
with no plastic properties, we show that if the positions of the 
holes are distributed in R^2 according to a Poisson law with 
positive density (lambda) and the distribution of the shapes of the holes is 
independent of the distribution of their centers, the tension vanishes 
on all of R^2 for any value of the density. 

In fact, this result follows from a more general theorem on the behavior 
of iterated convex hulls of connected subsets of R^d.
For this problem, we establish the existence of a 
non-random N=N(\lambda) such that N (or less) iterative 
convex hull operations are enough for covering all of
R^d almost surely. We also show that if \lambda > 0
is sufficiently small and the diameters of the sets of the original
configuration are bounded from above, N(\lambda)> 2 almost
surely.
