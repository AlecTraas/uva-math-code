         Lieb-Thirring inequalities in a strong magnetic field


ABSTRACT: 
Lieb-Thirring type inequalities are bounds on the moments of 
negative eigenvalues for Schrodinger type operators.  They are 
used as an apriori control to obtain stability of matter
and semiclassical asymptotics. In this talk I will review
the current status of such inequalities when a magnetic field
is included and the Pauli operator is considered. It turns
out that the strong field regime is especially interesting.
Recently, jointly with J. P. Solovej (Univ. of Copenhagen),
we proved an estimate which scales correctly in the field strength,
hence it can be used to prove uniform semiclassical asymptotics.
