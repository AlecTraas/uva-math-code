	Large Deviations: Cramer's theorem and Gibb's Conditioning Principle

This is the second talk of a series of teaching/research seminars on
large deviations.  We will begin with Cramer's theorem for sums of
independent random variables, then go on to problems for diffusions, e.g.,
Schilder's theorem.  We will be interested in the problem of
developing higher asymptotics.
