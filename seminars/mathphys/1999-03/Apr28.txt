Mathematical Physics Seminar
Wednesday April 28 2004, 2-3:30pm, 228 Kerchof Hall


SPEAKER:   Cristina Draghici

TITLE: "Symmetrization and Heat Kernels"

ABSTRACT: We present rearrangement inequalities for
multiple integrals, proved using the polarization
technique. Polarization refers to rearranging a function
with respect to a hyperplane. Then we derive
sharp inequalities for ratios of integrals of heat
kernels of Svhr"odinger operators, using our polarization
inequalities. These ratio inequalities imply inequalities 
for the partition functions and extend the results of 
R. Banuelos, P.J. Mendez-Herndandez and D. You.
