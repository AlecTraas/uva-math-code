The one-dimensional hard-core gas and three-dimensional branched polymers

I will talk about an elementary method for computing the Green's function
for the one-dimensional hard-core gas.  This is related to the Green's 
function for branched polymers in three dimensions.  I will discuss the 
asymptotic forms of these functions near the critical point (at negative 
ectivity, in the case of the hard-core gas).
