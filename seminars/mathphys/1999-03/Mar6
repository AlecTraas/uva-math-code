The Sine-Gordon transformation, hard-core gases, and the Yang-Lee edge

I will show how the Sine-Gordon transformation (usually used to get a field-theory
representation of the Coulomb gas) turns some hard-core gases into field theories 
with exponential interactions.  At the repulsive-core singularity at negative activity,
this field theory is in the Yang-Lee class (cubic interaction with imaginary coefficient).
