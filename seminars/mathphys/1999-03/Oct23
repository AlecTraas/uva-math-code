Alex Jimenez-Maza 
"Holonomic Constraints"
3:30, Monday October 21.

The talk is concerned with classical Hamiltonian systems with magnetic
fields and a strong potential forcing the system onto a sub-manifold
in phase space, and is a continuation of previous talks.  A
specific example of a constrained system is to be considered.
