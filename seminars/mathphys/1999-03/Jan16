           Pat McDonald (visiting Almut)
Arrive:    Tuesday, Jan 15, mid-morning
Leave:     Wednesday

I've asked Pat to give a talk on his most recent work Tuesday
afternoon. I don't have a proper title and abstract, but have
included a portion of his letter below.

              "Moment problems, heat content, and Dirichlet spectrum
                for smoothly bounded compact Riemannian manifolds"


From Pat's letter:

<  " ... As for the talk, it would concern some work I recently completed 
<   involving moment problems, heat content, and Dirichlet spectrum for 
<   smoothly bounded compact Riemannian manifolds.  The idea is to use 
<   exit time moments as an alternative to the Dirichlet spectrum to bound 
<   geometry, etc.  The main results look like "average exit time moments 
<   (average over starting point) determine the small time asymptotics 
<   of the heat content, as well as a `large' portion of the Dirichlet 
<   spectrum" (generically, they determine the Dirchlet spectrum, at 
<   least for Euclidean domains).  I also have a preliminary result 
<   that indicates that `average moments' distinguish isospectral polygons.  
<   There are close ties to zeta functions and still some things that I 
<   don't understand ... "
