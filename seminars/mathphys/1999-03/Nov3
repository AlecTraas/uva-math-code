   "Perturbation Theory for symmetric Hamiltonian systems"

Abstract: 
The problem of persistence, bifurcation, stability of periodic 
orbits and equilibria is of special importance in perturbation 
theory, and many results are known (e.g., Poincare', Weinberg, 
Moser). We generalize thse results to systems having symmetries 
given by a Hamiltonian action of a Lie group. Here the natural 
objects of study are _relative periodic orbits_ (orbits that are 
closed up to group action) and _relative equilibria_. We derive 
a recipe  for reducing the theory to the classical theory, which 
works even in the hard case when we reduce at a singular value of 
the moment map (as we often must in real life). Plane vortices
are discussed as examples; moreover, some of their exact
solutions show that the hypothesis in our recipe is tight.

main interest is symplectic geometry.
