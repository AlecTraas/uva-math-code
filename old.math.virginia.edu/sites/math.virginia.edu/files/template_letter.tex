\opening{Dear Professor Hires-alot:}

(This is the famous "universal letter of recommendation" written by Bob Stong. It's good for a laugh.)

I am writing for Mr.~Candidate who has applied for a position with
your department. I cannot recommend him too highly.

There is no other student with whom I can adequately compare him. The amount of mathematics he knows will surprise you.

His dissertation is the sort of work you don't expect to see these days. In it, he has definitely demonstrated his complete capabilities.

You will be fortunate if you can get him to work for you.



\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
