# Virginia Mathematics Lectures


In 2014, the IMS established the Distinguished Lecture Series "Virginia Mathematics Lectures." The inaugural speaker was Professor Alex Lubotzky from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Each semester thereafter brought us another speaker in the series, including Vaughan Jones (Vanderbilt), Ian Agol (UC Berkeley), and – most recently – Benedict H. Gross (Harvard).

These lecture series were enthusiastically met by the audience which included undergraduate and graduate students, faculty members and guests from other departments and institutions. Given the success of the lectures, the IMS will continue to organize two such series every year.

#### Lecture 1: The rank of elliptic curves

*Abstract:* Cubic equations in two variables, or elliptic curves,
have been in the forefront of number theory since since the time of Fermat.
I will focus on the group of rational points, which Mordell proved was
finitely generated. I will review the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-
Dyer, which attempts to predict the rank of this group from the average
number of points ($$mod p$$), and will discuss the progress that has been
made on this conjecture to date.


#### Lecture 2: The arithmetic of hyperelliptic curves

*Abstract:* Hyperelliptic curves first appeared in work of Abel, who generalized
Euler's addition laws for elliptic integrals. Abel defined their genus $$g$$ as the number
of integrals of the first kind. Every hyperelliptic curve of genus g has an affine
equation of the form $$y^2 = F(x)$$, where $$F(x)$$ is a separable polynomial of degree
$$2g+2$$ or $$2g+1$$. Abel, Legendre, Jacobi, and Riemann studied these curves over
the real and complex numbers. In this talk, I will focus on curves defined over the
rational numbers, and will study the set of their rational solutions. Faltings proved
that when the genus $$g$$ is at least $$2$$, this set is finite. Using ideas of Bhargava,
one can now show that it is usually empty.


#### Lecture 3: Heegner points on modular curves

*Abstract:* In this talk, we will briefly review the theory of complex multiplication
and define certain special points, called Heegner points, on the modular curves
$$X_0(N)$$.
Following Birch, we will consider the divisor classes supported on these
points in the Jacobian, and will discuss methods that can be used to show that these classes are non-trivial.
We will end with applications to the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer for elliptic curves over the rational numbers.

- Lecture 1: L-functions and Number Theory
- Lecture 2: The Trace Formula and Automorphic Forms
- Lecture 3: Beyond Endoscopy and Functoriality

#### General Abstract

Number theory is founded on the basic properties of integers and prime numbers. But its study these days is increasingly leading us to the far reaches of some of the most diverse and powerful areas of mathematics. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Langlands program, which represents a profound unifying force for mathematics.

We shall try to introduce the Langlands program through the theory of L-functions. These are infinite series that look like the famous Riemann zeta function, except that they have nontrivial coefficients. The information that goes into the coefficients is in fact very interesting, and gives an elegant way of organizing fundamental data from number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry. The Langlands program postulates deep relationships among different L-functions, and hence also the data in their coefficients.

We shall discuss these matters, and explain how they are part of the theory of automorphic forms. We shall then describe the trace formula, which has led to important results in the classification of automorphic representations. If time permits, we shall also say something about Beyond Endoscopy, a proposal by Langlands for attacking the central conjecture of the subject known as the Principle of Functoriality.

### Algebra, Geometry and Analysis over Finite Fields

#### Lecture 1

*Abstract:* In this lecture, we review how Noether's introduction of the concept of an abstract ring changed the course of mathematics in the twentieth century by enabling us to apply the methods of  "reduction modulo p" to solve problems in algebraic geometry. Specifically, I'll discuss how understanding solutions to polynomials over finite fields can help understand the geometry of geometric objects (called varieties) defined by real or complex polynomials. Miraculously, rings of characteristic p have some very special properties that can be powerful tools in analyzing them, often replacing tools like integration for real manifolds.

#### Lecture 2

*Abstract:* In the second lecture, we review Hironaka's famous theorem on the resolution of singularities of a complex algebraic variety. We show this theorem can help us understand and measure the singularities of complex varieties. Amazingly, it turns out that the only algebraic characterization of a geometric condition called "rational singularities" involves reduction to characteristic p. Specifically, we will see how algebraic tools such as Frobenius splitting impact  different areas of math, including the minimal model program for complex algebraic varieties and cluster algebras in combinatorics/representation theory.



#### Lecture 3

*Abstract:* In the final lecture, we discuss a numerical invariant of singularities called the analytic index of singularities, which is defined by the convergence of a certain integral. Amazingly, this invariant turns out to have a prime characteristic description as well, as the limit, over all primes p, of another invariant called the F-pure threshold. The study of these F-pure thresholds leads to some very interesting and mysterious fractal like behavior.

### The Virtual Haken Conjecture

*Abstract:* Waldhausen conjectured in 1968 that every aspherical 3-manifold has a finite-sheeted cover which is Haken (contains an embedded essential surface). Thurston conjectured that hyperbolic 3-manifolds have a finite-sheeted cover which fibers over the circle.

#### An overview of 3-Manifold Topology

*Abstract:* The first lecture will be an overview of  3-manifold topology in order to explain the meaning Waldhausen's virtual Haken conjecture and Thurston's virtual fibering conjecture, and how they relate to other problems in 3-manifold theory.


#### Lecture 2: What is Geometric Group Theory?

*Abstract:* The second lecture will give some background on geometric group theory, including the topics of hyperbolic groups and $$CAT(0)$$ cube complexes after Gromov, and explain how the above conjectures may be reduced to a conjecture of Dani Wise in geometric group theory.


#### Lecture 3: Geometric Group Theory and the Virtual Haken Conjecture

*Abstract:*  The third lecture will discuss the proof of Wise's conjecture, that cubulated hyperbolic groups are virtually special. Part of this result is joint work with Daniel Groves and Jason Manning. We will attempt to make these lectures accessible to a general mathematical audience at the level of a colloquium talk.

#### Lecture 1:  Knots and Groups

*Abstract:* Knots are among the more concrete features in the mathematical landscape. Groups are more pervasive and more abstract. But the two subjects have been intimately connected since the early days of the study of both. After defining knots and groups we will give the first such connection-the "fundamental group" of the knot. This group is known to determine the knot but a construction is not immediate. The braid group is a concrete group with some structural resemblance to knots. We will show how all knots arise from elements of the braid group and how to learn things about the knot from its braid.  In particular a family of “knot polynomials” appears from this study.


#### Lecture 2: Von Neumann Algebra and Physics

*Abstract:*  The states of a quantum system are given by vectors in a Hilbert space with inner product $$\langle \xi,\eta \rangle$$. Observables are self-adjoint operators on that Hilbert space. The fundamental formula connecting the two is that if $$a$$ is an operator/observable and $$\xi$$ is a unit vector/state then $$\langle a\xi,\eta \rangle$$ is a real number giving the average value of repeated measurements of the observable $$a$$ if the system is prepared each time in the state $$\xi$$. Von Neumann introduced the algebras that bear his name in large part to help understand the mathematical structure of quantum theory. His prophetic ideas have been very fruitful in low dimensional quantum field theory and are intimately related to the knot polynomials of the first lecture.


#### Lecture 3: Do all Subfactors arise in Conformal Field Theory?

*Abstract:* A subfactor is a pair of von Neumann algebras with trivial center (factors) one included in the other. A subfactor $$N \subset M$$ has an index $$[M : N]$$ which is a real number defined by von Neumann’s theory. For the most obvious examples of factors $$[M : N]$$ is actually an integer but in fact it can be any number in the set $$\{4\cos^2(\frac\pi n) \colon n = 3, 4, 5, 6, ...\} \cup [4, \infty]$$. Subfactors realising these values can be constructed from algebras of observables as in the second lecture. It is an open and intriguing question whether or not ALL subfactors (of finite index) can be obtained from quantum field theory. An attempt to take a continuum limit from the data of a subfactor has led to a new construction of knots and links from certain groups of homeomorphisms of the unit interval known as the Thompson groups.

### Expanders: From One-Dimensional to Multi-Dimensional

#### Lecture 1: Expander Graphs and Geometric/Topological Expanders

*Abstract:* Expander graphs have played an important role, in the last four decades, in many areas of computer science. Recently they have already found applications in pure mathematics. We describe some of this history and present in these three talks some recent efforts to build a high-dimensional theory of expanders. We will start with Gromov's geometric and topological expanders.

#### Lecture 2: From Ramanujan Graphs to Ramanujan Complexes

*Abstract:* Ramanujan graphs are optimal expanders. Their explicit construction is based on deep results of Deligne and Drinfeld in the theory of automorphic forms of $$GL(2)$$. The work of Lafforgue for $$GL(d)$$ enables the developments of high-dimensional objects: the Ramanujan complexes. These simplical complexes/hyper graphs enjoy some remarkable properties, being random-like but at the same time very symmetric. We will show how this helps to solve some problems in computer science (e.g., error-correcting codes) and in geometry.

#### Lecture 3: Coboundary Expanders and Property Testing

*Abstract:* Another direction of generalizing expanders from graphs to simplical complexes was proposed independently by Linial-Meshulam (in the context of developing Erodos-type theory of random simplical complexes) and by Gromov (when studying overlapping properties). We explain this notion and show a surprising connection with "property testing" which is a subject of fundamental importance, in theory and practice, in computer science.
