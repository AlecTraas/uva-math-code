## Stipends and support

<p>There is no separate application form for financial aid; all applicants for admission to the Ph.D. program are automatically considered.</p>

<p>Almost all mathematics doctoral graduate students are guaranteed five years of full support at the University, with financial aid awarded on an annual basis, contingent upon satisfactory progress.</p>

<p>Entering students typically have teaching fellowships, which involve assisting in discussion sections of undergraduate courses. Most advanced students have teaching assistantships, which involve teaching lower division undergraduate courses such as calculus. A small number of students may also be supported through university fellowships, outside fellowships, and research grants.</p>

<p>Stipends include an allowance for health insurance, tuition, and fees.</p>

<p>Additional support in the summer is usually available for students who continue to demonstrate progress toward their degree during the summer.</p>

<p>Currently, significant funding for our graduate program is provided by a U.S. Department of Education GAANN grant.&nbsp; (GAANN stands for Graduate Assistance in Area of National Need). This grant includes funding for summer programs and dissertation-year fellowships, and supports transitional summer classes for incoming graduate students.</p>

## Jefferson Scholars Foundation Graduate Fellowships

<p>The Mathematics Department is able to nominate a small number of applicants to be considered for <strong>Jefferson Scholars Foundation Graduate Fellowships</strong>.&nbsp; The award of these prestigious and remunerative&nbsp; 5 year fellowships is based on strong academic disciplinary credentials, <em>combined</em> with an interest in reaching out to a broad audience.&nbsp; Fellows participate in the various Jefferson Scholar activities throughout their graduate studies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Candidates nominated by the various University departments are invited by the Foundation to attend a selection competition conducted in late February which lasts a couple days and includes lectures by University faculty and administrators, meetings with faculty and students, and a formal interview.</p>

<p><em>Mathematics graduate program applicants who think they might be good candidates for one these fellowships, and for whom this program seems intriguing, should indicate this in their application personal statement.</em></p>
