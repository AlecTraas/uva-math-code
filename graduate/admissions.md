<p><strong>Please note that we do not usually admit students for a Master&#39;s degree only; we admit students seeking a PhD</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Criteria for Admission:</strong><br />
In making its decisions about admission and financial aid, the Department is first and foremost looking for students that we feel will flourish in our program. To determine if a student will be successful, the Department pays close attention to the overall undergraduate record, letters of recommendation, GRE scores (both on the general examinations and on the mathematics subject exam), and the student&#39;s personal statement.</p>

<p>Regarding the undergraduate record, the rigor of the applicant&#39;s mathematics program is an important factor; a good grounding in real analysis (as in our MATH 5310 and MATH 5330), algebra (as in MATH 5651/5652), general topology (as in MATH 5700), and complex analysis (as in MATH 3340) is ideal. For students from smaller schools, we have found that a solid score on the Mathematics Subject Exam is a useful indicator of future success.</p>

<p>Students occasionally arrive with an area of interest in mind, planning to work with a specific research group: this is quite common for international students. Foreign applicants are particularly encouraged to contact our faculty about their specific mathematical interests.</p>

<p>Students interested in our program in the history of mathematics should contact Professor Karen Parshall for admission prerequisites.</p>

<p>Finally, we are looking for enthusiasm for mathematics in all its depth and beauty!</p>

<p><strong>International Students:</strong> As the University&#39;s most international department, we welcome applications from foreign students!</p>

<p>The following websites for international students should be helpful:</p>

<ul>
	<li>General information for admitted international students:&nbsp;<a href="http://issp.virginia.edu/newly-admitted-students">http://issp.virginia.edu/newly-admitted-students</a></li>
	<li>International Studies Office: <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/iso/">http://www.virginia.edu/iso/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>New teaching assistants whose first language is not English&nbsp; have their spoken English proficiency evaluated by the International Students Office and Teaching Resource Center. This test is similar to ETS&#39;s Test of Spoken English (TSE), and students who have taken the TSE, and have a high enough score, can be exempted from this evaluation.</p>
