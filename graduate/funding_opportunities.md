### Departmental Money

We have money to support graduate student travel to conferences, workshops,
and other institutions for work-related visits. Apply for funding with the host
insitutions, but then also email <a

### Conferences Organizers

Many conferences have money to support the travel of younger mathematicians. If you are attending a conference and need funding, you should contact the organizers and ask if funding is available and what you need to do to procure it.
