<p>The Mathematics Department at the University of Virginia offers graduate students the opportunity to do research in a wide range of specialties. To help students with the daunting task of planning their multi-year program, in this guide we describe standard routes through the main research areas that students can currently pursue. We expect most students to follow one of these paths.</p>

<p>For convenience, we have grouped these within Programs in Algebra, Analysis, Topology, and the History of Mathematics. However, it is to be emphasized that there is much interaction between these, and a course of study might easily fall between areas. Furthermore, research areas undergo constant change due to changing faculty and student interests, and to new faculty joining the Department. Finally, there are a number of possible courses of study not listed here that may involve collaboration with faculty from other departments.</p>

<strong>Research Seminar</strong><br />
Algebra students are also required to take and to participate actively in MATH 9950 (Algebra Seminar) every semester after the first year. In the <em>first semester of the second year</em>, students contemplating working in algebra should contact a faculty member regarding a topic for a literature survey and, during the <em>second semester</em>, give a short expository talk in the Algebra Seminar.<br />
<br />
<strong>Second-Year Proficiency Exam</strong><br />
In the second year, students take the Second-Year Proficiency Exam, which, in algebra, consists of a conversation with a panel of faculty members on the material of two or three second-year algebra courses taken by the student, and on the bibliographical research done by the student and presented in MATH 9950.<br />

<h3>1.2 Linear and Arithmetic Groups and Associated Structures</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Faculty</strong><br />
P. Abramenko, M. Ershov, and A. Rapinchuk</p>

<p>Research in this area focuses on structural, combinatorial and homological properties of linear groups over general rings with a special emphasis on arithmetic rings (i.e., the rings of <em>S</em>-integers in global fields). Topics include the normal subgroup structure of the groups of rational points of algebraic groups and of their important subgroups, finiteness properties of arithmetic groups in positive characteristic, the rigidity of representations of finitely generated groups and building theory, in particular, group actions on spherical, affine, and twin buildings. The work in this area requires methods of the theory of algebraic groups, algebraic number theory, homological algebra, and combinatorial geometry/topology.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended Advanced Courses</strong><br />
MATH 7600 Homological Algebra, MATH 8851 Group Theory, MATH 8600 Commutative Algebra, MATH 8620 Algebraic Geometry, and special topics courses (or reading courses) in algebraic groups, arithmetic groups, geometric group theory, algebraic number theory, and building theory.<br />

<h3>1.3 Representation Theory</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Faculty</strong><br />
B. Parshall, L. Petrov, W. Wang, and B. Webster</p>

<p>Representation theory deals with representations of algebraic and associated finite groups, associative and Lie algebras, and connections with algebraic geometry and mathematical physics. Topics include representations of reductive algebraic groups in positive characteristic with applications to finite groups of Lie type, quantum groups and Hecke algebras, quasi-hereditary algebras and vertex algebras. This work used methods from the theory of algebraic groups and algebraic geometry, Lie algebras, and homological algebra.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Advanced Courses</strong><br />
MATH 7600 Homological Algebra, MATH 8851 Group Theory, MATH 8852 Representation Theory, MATH 8620 Algebraic Geometry, MATH 8700 Lie Groups, MATH 8710 Lie Algebras, and special topics courses (or reading courses) in algebraic groups, Kac-Moody algebras, symmetric groups and their representations, Hecke algebras and quantum groups.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1.4 Commutative Algebra</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Faculty</strong><br />
C. Huneke</p>

<p>Commutative algebra studies the space of solutions of polynomial and power series equations in many variables, often by creating a &quot;generic&quot; solution space, and investigating the properties of this space, and its specializations and deformations.</p>

<p>In the early 20th century, commutative algebra was born out of three classical fields: algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory. Today it retains connections to all of these areas, as well as many other areas such as combinatorics, homological algebra, representation theory, computational algebra, singularity theory, and algebraic statistics.</p>

<p>One of the most important techniques in modern commutative algebra is that of reduction to characteristic <em>p</em>, and the study and classification of singularities through invariants coming from this reduction.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Courses to take if interested in the field: MATH 7600, Homological Algebra; MATH 8600, Commutative Algebra; and MATH 8620, Algebraic Geometry.</p>

<h3>2.1 Core Courses and Requirements in Analysis</h3>

<p>Students intending to do research in some area of analysis must take the following courses:</p>

<p><strong>First Year</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>MATH 7310 Real Analysis and Linear Spaces I, MATH 7340 Complex Analysis I</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second Year</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>First Semester: MATH 7410 Functional Analysis I</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional courses and requirements depend on the specific research area selected by a student, as specified below.</p>

<p><strong>General Exam</strong><br />
The General Exam in Analysis has two parts: the first part based on material from MATH 7310, and the second part based on material from one of MATH 7340, MATH 7250, and MATH 7360. For students planning to work in analysis, the second part of the general exam should fit with the area they are pursuing.</p>

<p><strong>Research Seminars</strong><br />
Students in analysis in the second year and beyond are expected to participate in one of the analysis research seminars. These seminars are an important component of the graduate program, and are student-oriented. They aim to expand upon material covered in the various courses and to prepare students for independent reading of research papers.</p>

<p>In the <em>first semester of the second year</em>, students contemplating working in an area of analysis should contact a faculty member regarding a topic for a literature survey, and, during the <em>second semester</em>, give a short talk in the appropriate seminar.</p>

<p><strong>Second-Year Proficiency Exam</strong><br />
Also in the second year, students take the Second-Year Proficiency Exam, which, in analysis, consists of a conversation with a panel of faculty members on the material from two or three second-year analysis courses, and and on the bibliographical research done by the student for their seminar presentation.</p>

<p>Graduate research in topology is organized into the following areas: Algebraic Topology, Geometric Topology. We must emphasize that these areas have a lot in common, so the subdivision into &quot;algebraic&quot; and &quot;geometric&quot; is not always precise.</p>

<p><a name="threepointone"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>3.1 Core Courses and Requirements in Topology</h3>

<h3>3.2 Algebraic Topology</h3>

<p><br />
<strong>Faculty</strong><br />
J. Bergner and N. Kuhn</p>

<p>The subject of algebraic topology is the interplay between topology and algebra. One associates algebraic objects, e.g., groups and rings, with topological spaces in a &#39;natural&#39; way, and investigates how the algebraic invariants reflect the topological structure of the spaces. Research in this area requires a good understanding of both topology and algebra. Areas of particular interest to faculty include homotopical algebra and homotopy as organized by the calculus of functors, group cohomology and its connections to representation theory and algebraic <em>K</em>-theory, and the study of complex oriented cohomology theories. There are deep connections with many parts of algebra, including algebraic geometry and number theory, and mathematical physics.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended Advanced Courses</strong><br />
MATH 7840 Homotopy Theory, MATH 8800 Generalized Cohomology, MATH 7600 Homological Algebra, MATH 8700 Lie Groups, MATH 8650 Algebraic <em>K</em>-Theory, MATH 8830 Cobordism and K-Theory, and special topics (or reading courses) in calculus of functors and homotopical algebra.</p>

<h2>4 Graduate Program in the History of Mathematics</h2>

<p><br />
<strong>Faculty</strong><br />
K. Parshall</p>

<p>The graduate program in the history of mathematics includes a component in the history of science taken within the Department of History. Students in the program must satisfy all of the requirements for the Ph.D. in Mathematics. In particular, they must complete the coursework in mathematics and perform satisfactorily on General Examinations in two areas before they are permitted to proceed toward the doctorate. Strong reading competency in either French or German is required for admission into the program, with strong reading competency required in the other language by the time dissertation research begins. Depending on a particular student&#39;s interests, other languages may also be required.</p>

<p><strong>Program Coursework</strong><br />
The following is typical for a student in the graduate program in the history of mathematics:</p>

<p><strong>First Year</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>First Semester: MATH 7310 (Real Analysis), MATH 7510 (Algebra I), MATH 5770 (General Topology), or one additional mathematics course (to be determined depending on the student&#39;s future historical interests).</li>
	<li>Second Semester: MATH 7320 (Real Analysis II), MATH 7520 (Algebra II), one additional mathematics course (again to be determined depending on the student&#39;s future historical interests). General exams are taken at the end of the summer after the first year.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Second Year</strong></p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>First Semester: MATH 7753 (Algebra III), HIEU 3321 (The Scientific Revolution) (taken as MATH 9999), MATH 7340 (Complex Analysis), or one additional mathematics course depending on specific interests and needs, MATH 7000, and MATH 9010.</li>
	<li>Second Semester: MATH 5010 (The History of the Calculus) or MATH 5030 (The History of Mathematics) (depending on the year), HIUS 3401 (The Development of American Science) (taken as MATH 9999), MATH 7800 (Algebraic Topology I), or one additional course depending on specific needs and interests. The summer after the second year involves directed readings geared toward the isolation of an eventual dissertation topic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Third Year and Beyond</strong><br />
Additional mathematics courses to complete the number of hours required for the degree (chosen in consultation with the adviser), and any additional courses as needed (in, for example, language(s), history, or philosophy).</p>

<p><strong>Research Seminar</strong><br />
Students are expected to participate actively in MATH 9010 History of Mathematics Seminar in all semesters.</p>

<p><strong>Dissertation Proposal</strong><br />
For students in this program, the proposal defense replaces the Second-Year Proficiency Exam. It generally takes place before the end of the third year. Successful defense of the proposal represents &quot;permission to proceed&quot; to the dissertation phase of the program. The proposal is a written document (generally thirty to forty pages in length, exclusive of bibliography) that is presented in a public forum. It</p>

<ul>
	<li>details and justifies the historical questions the student proposes to explore in the dissertation;</li>
	<li>provides a detailed sketch of what the dissertation will cover, how it will be organized, and why;</li>
	<li>situates the proposed work within the broader literature of the history of science and mathematics; and</li>
	<li>provides a detailed (first approximation) of the dissertation&#39;s bibliography.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
</ul>
