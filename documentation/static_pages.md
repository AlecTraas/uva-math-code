# Static pages and Navigation Bar

---

## Overview

The navigation bar
(which is between the UVA brand and the main content of the page and contains the core hierarchy of the website)
is built automatically. 
There are 3 types of pages which interact with the navigation bar:

##### 1. First level label pages

Their navigation id's appear in the collapsed navigation bar (example: "About" or "Seminars")

##### 2. Second level pages

Their navigation id's are nested under a first level label, and 
whose links are shown in the dropdown menus visible when clicking on the first level labels (example: "Algebra Seminar")

##### 3. Highlighting pages

Their links are not shown in dropdown menus as second level ones, but which are clearly related to a certain first- or second-level page. At these pages the corresponding links in the navigation bar are highlighted (example: seminar archive pages, click [here]({{site.url}}/seminars/algebra/2008-09/) to see the highlighting of the corresponding first- and second-level labels)

Details of the interaction with the navigation bar are described below. 
There are of course other pages which do not interact with the navigation bar, 
and they can be reached by clicking through links on the website.
