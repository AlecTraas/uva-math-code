You are invited to be a member of the [Association for Women in Mathematics Student Chapter at UVa]({{site.url}}/awm/).

If you'd like to know more, please come to one of our interest meetings, on **September 5th at 6:15 in Kerchof 314 or September 6th at 7 pm in Clark 148**. If you have questions, please contact us at [math-awm@virginia.edu](mailto:math-awm@virginia.edu).

Our goal is to support and encourage women in Mathematics, building a community of people who like Math, open to everyone, not just women. We have several activities planned for this year, including Math talks, a mentorship program, and panels on topics like research opportunities or grad school.
