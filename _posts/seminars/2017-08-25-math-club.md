Welcome to the new academic year!

**If you are an undergraduate student interested in mathematics, you are invited to our [Math Club]({{site.url}}/seminars/mathclub/)**

The Undergraduate Math Club at University of Virginia is a weekly seminar and a club for students interested in mathematics and related areas. The regular meeting times (with _pizza_) of the Club are on Tuesdays at 5pm. An up-to-date calendar of meetings (where the first meeting time will be posted soon) is at [`{{site.url}}/seminars/mathclub/`]({{site.url}}/seminars/mathclub/).

<i>If you want to join the Math Club mailing list (announcing weekly meetings and occasionally sending other interesting information), email {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="aso9t" %} or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="sm4cw" %}</i>

The Math Club is a students' space having an official UVA CIO status (a student-lead organization). This provides the Club with a student managing board which helps plan and organize events. {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="aso9t" %} and {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="sm4cw" %} are the faculty coordinators of the Club for the 2017-18 academic year.

The activities at the Math Club include, but are not limited to:

- talks by math faculty and graduate students, from the UVA Math Department, or visiting here
- math-related talks by people from other UVA departments (for example, Physics or Philosophy)
- presentations by local math-related industry companies
- presentations by undergraduate students on their research projects, activities, or something they find interesting
- panel discussions (for example, on REUs, or on careers for math majors)
- outside trips (such as to a math-related movie, or to the UVA 3D printing lab)
- organization of [MMATHS](http://www.mmaths.org/), a nation-wide competition for high school students co-hosted at UVA

You can check out past Math Club activities at its page [`{{site.url}}/seminars/mathclub/`]({{site.url}}/seminars/mathclub/).
The Math Club is always open to ideas of other activities - please come to the first meeting and suggest!
