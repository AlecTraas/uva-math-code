**"Enumerative Geometry, Combinatorics, and Algebra: An Exploration of Hilbert's Fifteenth Problem and More!"**

On Thursday, October 17, 2024, we are excited to host the inaugural AWM Colloquium by Professor Linda Chen, an algebraic geometer from Swarthmore College, at 5:00 PM in Kerchof 111.

**Abstract**: Enumerative geometry is the art of counting geometric objects that satisfy various conditions. Indeed, when Hilbert listed 23 important unsolved problems for the twentieth century, his Fifteenth Problem was to understand the methods developed by nineteenth-century mathematicians based on the “principle of conservation of number.” In this talk, we will explore several enumerative geometry problems and their connections to combinatorial and algebraic structures. Modern techniques, recent results, and new directions will also be discussed. **No background in combinatorics or algebra is required** for attendees.
