<p>The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has named Assistant Professor Thomas Koberda as  a Sloan Research Fellow for 2017, an honor awarded to 126 early-career scientists and scholars in the United States and Canada. Only 20 were given nation-wide to mathematicians. The two-year, $60,000 fellowships are awarded to scientists "in recognition of distinguished performance and a unique potential to make substantial contributions to their field," according to the organization's website. Researchers are considered based on nominations, and then selected by an independent panel of senior scientists.</p>
