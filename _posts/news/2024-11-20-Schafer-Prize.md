Dear Colleagues,

The 2025 Alice T. Schafer Prize for Excellence in Mathematics by an Undergraduate Woman was recently announced: the three winners are tahda queer, Marie-Hélène Tomé, and Katherine Tung. The prizes will be awarded at the annual AMS meeting in January, but you can read the full citation [here](https://awm-math.org/awards/schafer-prize-for-undergraduates/schafer-prize-2025/).

I’m pleased to mention that one of the winners, Marie-Hélène Tomé, was a participant in the 2023 REU program in number theory at UVa, organized by Professor Ken Ono. Congratulations to her and all the winners!

Yours,
Thomas Mark
Chair, Mathematics
