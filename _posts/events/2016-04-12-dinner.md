The Gordon E. Keller Mathematics Majors Dinner will be held on Tuesday, April 12th, 2016 at the Courtyard- Marriott located on Main Street.

This Dinner was conceived and organized by a former major advisor, Professor Gordon Keller, as a way of expressing the department’s appreciation for you. It is a great opportunity for all of you to connect with the faculty and other math majors in a relaxed and lighthearted environment.

In addition to a delicious dinner, there will be an awards presentation and a talk by Dr. Berrien Moore III, who holds a PhD in Mathematics from our own department. He is currently the Dean of the College of Atmospheric and Geographical Sciences at the University of Oklahoma, as well as the Vice President of Weather and Climate Programs and the Director of the National Weather Center. Additionally, he holds the position of Chesapeake Energy Corporation Chair in Climate Studies. His talk is entitled  <em>From $S*TS=T$ to $CO_2$ and Climate; An Improbable Journey.</em>
