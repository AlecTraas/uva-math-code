<p><strong>Fair Weather:</strong>  <em>Finals on the Lawn, fair-weather sites for department graduation ceremonies</em><br /><strong>Pavilion I Lower Garden<br />
Ceremony Start Time: 12:15 p.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inclement Weather:</strong>  <em>Finals on the Lawn, all department ceremonies inside</em><br /><strong>Gilmer Hall Room 130<br />
Ceremony Start Time: 12:45 p.m.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Severe Weather:</strong>   <em>Finals in John Paul Jones Arena, all department ceremonies inside</em><br /><strong>Gilmer Hall Room 130<br />

<p><em>*Please note that Gilmer Hall Room 130 is a Remote Viewing Location for Finals on the Lawn.  We anticipate that the remote viewing will conclude prior to 12 p.m.</em></p>
<p>Under the severe-weather plan, ALL degree candidates (undergraduate and graduate) will participate in the ceremony at John Paul Jones Arena.  Each graduating student will receive <strong>six</strong> guest seating tickets for the Lawn.  Since we cannot accommodate as many people in the arena compared to the Lawn, graduates will be restricted to <strong>three</strong> guests if the ceremony is moved inside.  Tickets are required for all guests either on the Lawn or at the arena.  Guests without tickets can watch a live broadcast of the ceremony at one of the remote viewing locations across Grounds. </p>
<p>Complimentary parking will be available at Scott Stadium and at John Paul Jones Arena with shuttle bus service to Central Grounds.  Buses will load at the entrance of the Student Activities Building (located in the Scott Stadium west parking lot) and near the west entrance of the arena. Return shuttles to these lots will run continuously from Central Grounds throughout Saturday afternoon.  Parking is also available in the Emmet/Ivy parking garage ($5 per vehicle), which is about a 10 minute walk to the Lawn (no shuttle service).</p>
