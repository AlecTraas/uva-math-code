This Dinner was conceived and organized by a former major advisor, Professor Gordon Keller, to express the department's appreciation for the students. It is an excellent opportunity for everyone to connect with the faculty and other math majors in a relaxed and lighthearted environment. Looking forward to the next dinner in Spring 2024! 

In addition to a delicious dinner, there was an awards presentation and a talk by Lorena Bociu, who holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from our department. Dr. Bociu was currently a professor at NC State University. Her address talk is "Differential Equations, Ocular Perfusion, and ... Bugs".
