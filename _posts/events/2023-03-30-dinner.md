This Dinner was conceived and organized by a former major advisor, Professor Gordon Keller, to express the department's appreciation for you. It is an excellent opportunity for all of you to connect with the faculty and other math majors in a relaxed and lighthearted environment.

In addition to a delicious dinner, there will be an awards presentation and a talk by Lorena Bociu, who holds a Ph.D. in mathematics from our department. Dr. Bociu is currently a professor at NC State University. Her address is "Differential Equations, Ocular Perfusion, and ... Bugs".
