Congratulations to Ben Webster! He is one of two 2016 recipients of the prestigious Cory Family Teaching Awards, and joins David Sherman (2013) among the award recipients from the Mathematics department. The Cory Family Teaching Awards are "designed to reward and incentivize excellence in teaching among junior faculty." Since 2013 and continuing through 2017, two junior faculty members are chosen as recipients and honored at Fall Convocation. Each recipient is awarded $25,000 thanks to the generosity of Mr. and Mrs. Charles R. Cory. Well done, Ben!
