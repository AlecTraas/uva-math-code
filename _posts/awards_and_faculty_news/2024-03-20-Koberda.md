This spring, [Thomas Koberda was awarded a prestigious Simons Fellowship](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-fellows-in-mathematics/?tab=awardees) to support his research. The Simons Fellows program extends academic leaves from one term to a full year, enabling recipients to focus solely on research for the long periods often necessary for significant research advances. Congratulations!
