Our graduating senior undergrad, Zac Carlini, has won an NSF Graduate Fellowship and will be attending Yale graduate school in mathematics. Additionally, Zac has been awarded the McShane Prize this year. 

Zac's DMP thesis consists of two research papers, one on i-quantum groups and another on Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for Hecke algebra modules. His work on i-quantum groups provides a new formulation and short conceptual proof to the Serre relations and Serre-Lusztig relations.

We are incredibly proud of Zac's achievements and look forward to following his continued success at Yale. Congratulations, Zac!
