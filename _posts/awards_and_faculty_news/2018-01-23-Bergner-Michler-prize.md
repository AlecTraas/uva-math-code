The Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize of the AWM is awarded annually to a woman recently promoted to Associate Professor or an equivalent position in the mathematical sciences. The prize provides a fellowship for the awardee to spend a semester in the Mathematics Department of Cornell University without teaching obligations. Recently promoted associate professors face many challenges as they prepare to take on greater leadership in research and in the profession. The Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize will honor outstanding women at this stage of their careers and enable them to focus on their research in the stimulating environment of the Cornell University Mathematics Department.

A \$47,000 prize will be awarded to a woman, recently promoted to associate professor or the equivalent, for a semester of mathematical research without teaching obligations in the Mathematics Department of Cornell University. A supplement housing/subsistence stipend award of \$3,000 will be provided. Office space, library access, and computing facilities will be provided by Cornell. The award is to be used during the 2018-2019 academic year.
