We are happy to announce that the department of mathematics' Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant award for 2015-16 has been awarded to Xiang Wan. As winner of the departmental award, Xiang was nominated to compete for a University-wide award, and was selected as one of the top 15 of a very accomplished group of teachers. He was presented with a Jefferson Cup in honor of his achievement.

The department also recognizes two graduate teaching assistants with Honorable Mentions for our teaching award: they are Peter Bonventre and Jonathan Simone. All three of these outstanding GTAs will receive recognition and a cash prize at this yearâ€™s graduation ceremony.

Congratulations to Xiang, Peter, and Jon!
