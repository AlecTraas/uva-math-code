The Samir Aldroubi and Amira Azhari Prize for Excellence in Postdoctoral Research is awarded every two years to recognize the research achievements of current and recent postdoctoral fellows in the department. It was established by Mathematics Professor Akram Aldroubi in honor of his parents, Samir Aldroubi and Amira Azhari. Candidates for the Aldroubi-Azhari Award are nominated by the faculty of the department, and the recipient is selected by a departmental committee. The chosen mathematician receives $1,000 and is invited to Vanderbilt to deliver a mathematics colloquium reflecting his or her research interests.

Congratulations!
