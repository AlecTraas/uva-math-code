Our Ph.D. student, Louisa Liles, has been honored with the Roselle-Huneke Award (similar to the usual Dissertation Fellowships, but specifically for mathematics students). The award not only recognizes Louisaâ€™s exceptional work in quantum topology and knot invariants but also provides support for ongoing research.
