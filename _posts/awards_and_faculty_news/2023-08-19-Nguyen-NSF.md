One of our incoming first-year graduate students, Lam Nguyen, has been awarded an NSF scholarship. Lam hopes to explore hyperbolic geometry and study groups acting on hyperbolic space under the guidance of Prof. Maloni. We warmly congratulate Lam on this significant accomplishment and look forward to witnessing his contributions to the field.
