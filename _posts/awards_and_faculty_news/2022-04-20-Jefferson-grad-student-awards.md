Two of our graduate students have been awarded Jefferson Fellowships for next year. **Nhan Nguyen** is the first recipient of the Roselle-Huneke Award in Mathematics (similar to the usual Dissertation Fellowships, but specifically for mathematics students), and **Jiajun Yan** is one of the first cohort of GSAS Jefferson Fellows, who are supported with a fellowship in their final year of the PhD program, and then spend one postdoctoral year working with the Engagements program.
