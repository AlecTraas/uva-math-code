This year, the workshop will be organized around an AMS sectional meeting where there will be even [more excellent talks](http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2273_program_ss29.html#title) on related topics.

We are soliciting applications to **participate in the poster session!** Requests to present can be submitted on the [ **MAAGC registration form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uKOFx4Z-MVx7u75zfQ013gXjFlxp8VXKdS-qvqGB2og/viewform?ts=5e128b63&edit_requested=true) .

MAAGC is supported by a National Science Foundation grant and a Mellon Tri-College Roots grant. Funding is available for regional travel and housing. [Register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uKOFx4Z-MVx7u75zfQ013gXjFlxp8VXKdS-qvqGB2og/viewform?ts=5e128b63&edit_requested=true) **by February 1, 2020 to receive full consideration** for funding for travel and housing. *Some funds for childcare are available -- please contact the organizers as soon as possible if childcare is requested.*

***\*If total funding requests exceed available funds, priority will be given to junior participants presenting posters.**

More details can be found on the [MAAGC website](http://www.maagc.info/virginia-2020).

**Please** [**register for the AMS**](http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2273_other.html#adv) **meeting separately**; it will be a great chance to bring together senior researchers and junior mathematicians to exchange ideas and forge collaborations.
