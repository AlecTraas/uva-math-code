The University of Virginia will host the [Spring Southeastern Sectional Meeting of the American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/meetings/sectional/2273_program.html) on **March 13-15, 2020**. The three planary lectures will be given by Laura Ann Miller, Betsy Stovall, and Yusu Wang. We will also host the Einstein Lecture, given by Moon Duchin, which will be followed by a buffet dinner, and 35 special sessions spanning many different topics. There will also be a Career Development and Job Search Workshop for graduate student and the panel “Building diverse math communities”.

The seventh annual [Mid-Atlantic Algebra, Geometry, and Combinatorics](http://www.maagc.info/virginia-2020) (MAAGC) workshop will be held at UVA in conjunction with the AMS meeting.
