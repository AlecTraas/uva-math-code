There will be a one day Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar at University of Virginia on Saturday, October 26.
Speakers will be:
 
* Maria Basterra (University of New Hampshire)
* Mona Merling (University of Pennsylvania)
* Dylan Wilson (University of Chicago)
* W. Stephen Wilson (Johns Hopkins University)
 
This seminar is a regional conference with a goal of bringing together the mid-Atlantic algebraic topology community. It will also serve as one of the inaugural activities for the NSF RTG grant that the Topology and Geometry group at UVA recently received.

Title:  $v_n$ torsion free H-spaces
Abstract:   For some years there have been $(k-1)$-connected irreducible H-spaces, $Y_k$, with no p-torsion 
in homology or homotopy.  All p-torsion free H-spacesa are products of these spaces and they show up regularly
in the literature.  Boardman and I have generalized theses spaces and theorems using $(k-1)$ connected H-spaces, 
$Y_k$, that have no $v_n$ torsion in homology or homotopy (to be defined).  These spaces seem ripe for exploitation 
in the environment of chromatic homotopy theory.

Title: Real Hochschild homology and the norm of $F_2$.
Abstract: We study a spectral sequence computing the homotopy fixed points of the $C_2$ action on the smash square
of $HF_2$. As an application, we give another proof of the $C_2$-Segal conjecture as well as a stronger, 'quantitative' 
variant. This is joint work with Jeremy Hahn.
