There will be a one day Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar at University of Virginia on Saturday, October 26.
Speakers will be:
 
* Maria Basterra (University of New Hampshire)
* Mona Merling (University of Pennsylvania)
* Dylan Wilson (University of Chicago)
* W. Stephen Wilson (Johns Hopkins University)
 
This seminar is a regional conference with a goal of bringing together the mid-Atlantic algebraic topology community. It will also serve as one of the inaugural activities for the NSF RTG grant that the Topology and Geometry group at UVA recently received.
