There will be a one day Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar at University of Virginia on Saturday, October 26.
Speakers will be:
 
* Maria Basterra (University of New Hampshire)
* Mona Merling (University of Pennsylvania)
* Dylan Wilson (University of Chicago)
* W. Stephen Wilson (Johns Hopkins University)
 
This seminar is a regional conference with a goal of bringing together the mid-Atlantic algebraic topology community. It will also serve as one of the inaugural activities for the NSF RTG grant that the Topology and Geometry group at UVA recently received.

Title:  $v_n$ torsion free H-spaces

Abstract:   For some years there have been $(k-1)$-connected irreducible H-spaces, $Y_k$, with no p-torsion 
in homology or homotopy.  All p-torsion free H-spacesa are products of these spaces and they show up regularly
in the literature.  Boardman and I have generalized theses spaces and theorems using $(k-1)$ connected H-spaces, 
$Y_k$, that have no $v_n$ torsion in homology or homotopy (to be defined).  These spaces seem ripe for exploitation 
in the environment of chromatic homotopy theory.

Title: Spectral Mackey functors as multifunctors 
 
Abstract: I will discuss a new perspective on spectral Mackey functors as multifunctors. The main application I will 
talk about is the construction of a map from the suspension G-spectrum of a smooth G-manifold M to the equivariant 
A-theory of M, whose fiber, on fixed points, exhibits a "tom Dieck style" splitting into stable h-cobordism spaces.  
This is joint work with Cary Malkiewich.

Title: Real Hochschild homology and the norm of $F_2$.

Abstract: We study a spectral sequence computing the homotopy fixed points of the $C_2$ action on the smash square
of $HF_2$. As an application, we give another proof of the $C_2$-Segal conjecture as well as a stronger, 'quantitative' 
variant. This is joint work with Jeremy Hahn.

Title : Inverting operations in operads
 
Abstract :  We describe a variant of the Dwyer-Kan hammock localization that allows us to construct a localization
for operads with respect to submonoids of one-ary operations.  The construction is functorial.  It associates to an 
operad O and a submonoid of one-ary operations W, an operad LO and a canonical map O to LO which takes elements in W 
to homotopy invertible operations.
Furthermore, we give a functor from the category of O-algebras to the category of LO-algebras satisfying an appropriate 
universal property.
This is joint work with Irina Bobkova, Kate Ponto, Ulrike Tillmann and Sarah Yeakel.
