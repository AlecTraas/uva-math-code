### Hyperbolic 3-manifolds, their structure and deformations

*Lecture 1: November 13, 2017. Time and location: TBA*

**Abstract:**  Hyperbolic geometry is the richest and most interesting of Thurston's eight geometries for 3-manifolds. A good understanding of the ways in which hyperbolic geometry interacts with topology in three dimensions also informs our understanding of many related fields, such as geometric group theory and complex dynamics. We will give a brief introduction to this subject, trying to focus on examples, geometric intuition and overall structure.

### Between 2 and 3 dimensions: Teichmuller theory, pleated surfaces, and the complex of curves

*Lecture 2: November 14, 2017. Time and location: TBA*

**Abstract:** One can probe the geometry of a 3-manifold by mapping in surfaces in different ways: conformal boundaries at infinity give us a parametrization of families of 3-manifolds using classical Teichmuller space, and Thurston's pleated surfaces relate the varying geometry on the interior to 2-dimensional combinatorial and geometric structures. We will explore these notions and explain a little about how they provide a complete set of invariants for deformation spaces of 3-manifolds.

### Quantitative models, Thurston's skinning map, and beyond

*Lecture 3: November 15, 2017. Time and location: TBA*

**Abstract:** While the theory has had many successes, we are still far from having a complete "effective" recipe for predicting the geometry of a hyperbolic 3-manifold from its topological description. I will describe some ongoing work in this direction, and some remaining questions.
