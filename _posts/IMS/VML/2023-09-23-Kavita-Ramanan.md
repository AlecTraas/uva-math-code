<h5 class="mt-1 mb-1"><a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/applied-mathematics/faculty/kavita-ramanan/home">Kavita Ramanan</a> (Brown University) - Tales of high-dimensional distributions</h5>

Though they have a common thread, the three lectures will be self-contained, and can mostly be followed independently of each other.

<ul>
<li><b>Lecture 1: Tails of random projections: where probability meets geometry</b><br>November 13 | 5-6pm | Wilson 402 </li>
<li><b>Lecture 2: A probabilistic approach to the geometry of p-Schatten balls</b><br>November 14 | 5-6pm | Nau 101</li>
<li><b>Lecture 3: A unimodular Sanov's theorem and interacting particle systems on sparse random graphs</b><br>November 15 | 5-6pm | Wilson 402</li>
</ul>
