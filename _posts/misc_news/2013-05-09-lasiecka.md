StatStats.org has included Professor Irena Lasiecka in their list of the Top 26 Women Professors in Virginia. The goal of the top professors list is to highlight post-secondary educators who have been awarded recently for excellence in the classroom, on campus, and/or in the community. We found many professors who fit the bill, but focused on those recognized within the past 12 months.
