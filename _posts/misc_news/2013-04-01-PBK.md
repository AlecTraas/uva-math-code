<p>Congratulations to our majors, <em>Joseph Featherston</em>, <em>John Irby</em>, <em>Wenzhuo Lu</em>, <em>Rebecca Moye</em>, <em>Fei Song</em>, and <em>Michelle Ward</em>, who were elected <span>to the Beta Chapter of Virginia of Phi Beta Kappa</span>.</p>
<p>As the oldest and most distinguished honor society in the country, Phi Beta Kappa offers membership to less than one percent of all undergraduates.  Many of the leading figures in American history and culture have begun their careers with election to the society, including seventeen presidents of the United States.  As a result, membership is a remarkable accomplishment, both for the student who achieves it and the faculty and staff whose support and guidance has led to this milestone.</p>
