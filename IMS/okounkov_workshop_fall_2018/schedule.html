      <summary>Characterization of queer supercrystals</summary>
      <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">We provide a characterization of the crystal bases for the quantum queer superalgebra recently introduced by Grantcharov et al. This characterization is a combination of local queer axioms generalizing Stembridge's local axioms for crystal bases for simply-laced root systems, which were recently introduced by Assaf and Oguz, with further axioms and a new graph $G$ characterizing the relations of the type $A$ components of the queer crystal. We provide a counterexample to Assaf's and Oguz' conjecture that the local queer axioms uniquely characterize the queer supercrystal. We obtain a combinatorial description of the graph $G$ on the type $A$ components by providing explicit combinatorial rules for the odd queer operators on certain highest weight elements. This is joint work with Maria Gillespie, Graham Hawkes, and Wencin Poh.</div>

            <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">
                    The Hilbert scheme of the plane (or more generally, the resolution of the type A Kleinian singularity) has a surprising description as a Coulomb branch in the sense of Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima; this gives a rather odd looking presentation of the projective coordinate ring of this variety.  It turns out that this presentation is very well adapted to describing the tilting generators constructed using Bezrukavnikov and Kaledin's perspective; of course, there are many other interesting aspects of the combinatorics of coherent sheaves on these varieties, which hopefully the audience will have some thoughts about understanding this way.

                    Maulik and Okounkov described a stable basis for the $T$-equivariant cohomology ring $H^*_{T\times \mathbb{C}^{\times}}(T^*Gr_k(\mathbb{C}^n))$ of the cotangent bundle to a Grassmannian. A natural idea to consider is the product structure of these basis elements. In this talk I will give a way to compute the structure constants for the projective case, as well as a conjectural positive formula using puzzles. I will also discuss ideas for modifying this formula to apply to a general Grassmannian using R-matrices, based on work done by Knutson and Zinn-Justin.

                    The center of the integral group algebra of the general linear group $GL_n(q)$ over a finite field admits a filtration with respect to the reflection length. We show that the structure constants of the associated graded algebras are independent of n, and this stability leads to a universal stable center with positive integer structure constants which governs these graded algebras for all $n$. Various structure constants of the stable center are computed and several conjectures are formulated. Analogous stability properties for symmetric groups and wreath products were established earlier by Farahat-Higman and Wang. This is a joint work with Weiqiang Wang.

                    The Nonvanishing decision problem asks if a coefficient of a polynomial is nonzero. Work of C. Monical, N. Tokcan and the speaker explicated that many polynomials in algebraic combinatorics admit combinatorial counting rules and enjoy having "saturated Newton polytopes". Therefore, in amenable cases, Nonvanishing is in the complexity class of problems with "good characterizations". This suggests a new algebraic combinatorics paradigm for complexity theory. The talk will focus on the case of Schubert polynomials, a basis of all polynomials. These appear in the study of cohomology rings of flag varieties. We give a handy tableau criterion for Nonvanishing, from which we deduce the first polynomial time algorithm. This is based on joint work with Anshul Adve and Colleen Robichaux.

                        Catalan Functions and k-Schur functions

                        Li-Chung Chen and Mark Haiman studied a family of symmetric functions called Catalan (symmetric) functions which are indexed by pairs consisting of a partition contained in the staircase (n-1, ..., 1,0) (of which there are Catalan many) and a composition weight of length n. They include the Schur functions ,the Hall-Littlewood polynomials and their parabolic generalizations. They can be defined by a Demazure-operator formula, and are equal to GL-equivariant Euler characteristics of vector bundles on the flag variety by the Borel-Weil-Bott theorem. We have discovered various properties of Catalan functions, providing a new insight on the existing theorems and conjectures inspired by Macdonald positivity conjecture.
                        <br>
                        A key discovery in our work is an elegant set of ideals of roots that the associated Catalan functions are k-Schur functions and proved that graded k-Schur functions are G-equivariant Euler characteristics of vector bundles on the flag variety, settling a conjecture of Chen-Haiman. We exposed a new shift invariance property of the graded k-Schur functions and resolved the Schur positivity and k-branching conjectures by providing direct combinatorial formulas using strong marked tableaux. We conjectured that Catalan functions with a partition weight are k-Schur positive which strengthens the Schur positivity of Catalan function conjecture by Chen-Haiman and resolved the conjecture with positive combinatorial formulas in cases which capture and refine a variety of problems.

                    To a simply-laced Dynkin diagram, one can attach a complex simple Lie algebra, say $\mathfrak{g}$, and a class of Nakajima (quiver) varieties. The latter provides a natural home for a geometric representation theory of the former. If the algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is further equipped with an involution, it leads to a so-called symmetric pair $(\mathfrak{g},\mathfrak{k})$, where $\mathfrak{k}$ is the fixed-point subalgebra under involution. In this talk, I’ll present a recent study of fixed-point loci of Nakajima varieties under certain involutions and provide bridges at several levels between symmetric pairs and Nakajima varieties.

                        The equivariant Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson (CSM) class and the equivariant Motivic Chern (MC) class are fine characteristic classes of singular varieties in cohomology and K theory—and their theory overlaps with the theory of Okounkov’s stable envelopes. We study CSM and MC classes for the orbits of Dynkin quiver representations. We show that the problem of computing the CSM and MC classes of all these orbits can be reduced to some basic classes $c^o_\beta$, $C^o_\beta$ parameterized by positive roots $\beta$. We prove an identity in a deformed version of Kontsevich-Soibelman’s Cohomological (and K-theoretic) Hall Algebra (CoHA, KHA), namely, that a product of exponentials of $c^o_\beta$, $C^o_\beta$ classes formally depending on a stability function Z, does not depend on Z. This identity—which encodes infinitely many identities among rational functions in infinitely many variables—has the structure of Donaldson-Thomas type quantum dilogarithm identities. Using a wall-crossing argument we present the $c^o_\beta$, $C^o_\beta$ classes as certain commutators in the CoHA, KHA.

                        The graded characters of Demazure submodules of level-zero extremal weight modules over a simply-laced quantum affine algebra are solutions to certain difference equations known as the nonsymmetric $q$-Toda system (arising from nil-DAHA). By results of Kato and Kato-Naito-Sagaki, these graded characters ''control'' the equivariant K-theory of the associated semi-infinite flag manifold. I will explain some cases in which it has been possible to convert the difference equations into meaningful statements in equivariant K-theory. This is based on joint works with Feigin and Makedonskyi and with Naito and Sagaki.
