        <ul>
             <li>
              <b> Gurbir Dihillon (Yale University)</b>: Kazhdan–Lusztig theory for affine Lie algebras at critical level  <br>
              Abstract: A basic problem in representation theory is to calculate the characters of irreducible highest weight modules. For semisimple Lie algebras
              this was resolved by Beilinson-Bernstein and Brylinski-Kashiwara in the early 1980s. For affine Lie algebras, this was resolved by Kashiwara-Tanisaki
             at non-critical central charges in the early 1990s. At the remaining critical central charge certain cases are known by work of Arakawa-Fiebig, Feigin-Frenkel, 
             Frenkel-Gaitsgory, Hayashi, and Malikov. In forthcoming joint work with David Yang, we calculate the irreducible characters for the regular block at 
             critical level, confirming a conjecture of Feigin-Frenkel.

              <b> Eugene Gorsky (University of California, Davis)</b>: Tautological classes and symmetry in Khovanov–Rozansky homology  <br>
              Abstract: We define a new family of commuting operators $F_k$ in Khovanov–Rozansky link homology, similar to the action of tautological 
              classes in cohomology of character varieties. We prove that $F_2$ satisfies "hard Lefshetz property" 
              and hence exhibits the symmetry in Khovanov–Rozansky homology conjectured by Dunfield, Gukov and Rasmussen. This is a joint work with 
              Matt Hogancamp and Anton Mellit.

              <b>Mee Seong Im (United States Naval Academy)</b>: One-dimensional topological theories with zero-dimensional defects and finite state automata<br>
             Abstract: Quantum groups are related to 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories. Downsizing from three dimensions to one and from a ground
              field to a semiring, I will explain a surprising relation between topological theories for one-dimensional manifolds with defects and values in the
              Boolean semiring and finite-state automata and their generalizations. This is joint with Mikhail Khovanov.

              <b>Cris Negron (University of Southern California)</b>: Quantum SL(2) and logarithmic VOAs of type $A_1$ <br>
              Abstract: I will discuss recent work with Terry Gannon, where we show that various non-semisimple tensor categories of representations 
              for quantum SL(2) are identified with corresponding categories of modules for non-rational (aka logarithmic) vertex operator algebras.  
              Such relationships were conjectured to exist in works of Bushlanov, Feigin, Gainutdinov, Semikatov, and Tipunin from the mid 2000's.  
              At the conclusion I may touch on related, somewhat conjectural, "logarithmic TQFTs" for quantum groups at roots of unity.

               <b>Andrei Negut (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</b>: On the trace of the affine Hecke category <br>
               Abstract: We propose a connection between the horizontal trace of the affine Hecke category and the elliptic Hall algebra, mirroring known 
               constructions for the finite Hecke category. Explicitly, we construct a family of generators of the affine Hecke category, compute certain 
               categorified commutators between them, and show that their K-theoretic shadows match certain commutators in the elliptic Hall algebra. 
               Joint work with Eugene Gorsky.

               <b>Joshua Sussan (City University of New York, Medgar Evers)</b>: p-DG structures in higher representation theory <br>
               Abstract: One of the goals of the categorification program is to construct a homological invariant of 3-manifolds coming from the higher 
               representation theory of quantum groups.  The WRT 3-manifold invariant uses quantum groups at a root of unity. p-DG theory was introduced 
               by Khovanov as a means to categorify objects at prime roots of unity.  We will review this machinery and show how to construct categorifications 
               of certain representations of quantum sl(2) at prime roots of unity.
