              Eugene Gorsky (University of California, Davis): Tautological classes and symmetry in Khovanov–Rozansky homology  <br>
              Abstract: We define a new family of commuting operators $F_k$ in Khovanov–Rozansky link homology, similar to the action of tautological 
              classes in cohomology of character varieties. We prove that $F_2$ satisfies "hard Lefshetz property" 
              and hence exhibits the symmetry in Khovanov–Rozansky homology conjectured by Dunfield, Gukov and Rasmussen. This is a joint work with 
              Matt Hogancamp and Anton Mellit.

              Mee Seong Im (United States Naval Academy): One-dimensional topological theories with zero-dimensional defects and finite state automat<br>
             Abstract: Quantum groups are related to 3-dimensional topological quantum field theories. Downsizing from three dimensions to one and from a ground
              field to a semiring, I will explain a surprising relation between topological theories for one-dimensional manifolds with defects and values in the
              Boolean semiring and finite-state automata and their generalizations. This is joint with Mikhail Khovanov.

              Cris Negron (University of Southern California): Quantum SL(2) and logarithmic VOAs of type A_1 <br>
              Abstract:  I will discuss recent work with Terry Gannon, where we show that various non-semisimple tensor categories of representations 
              for quantum SL(2) are identified with corresponding categories of modules for non-rational (aka logarithmic) vertex operator algebras.  
              Such relationships were conjectured to exist in works of Bushlanov, Feigin, Gainutdinov, Semikatov, and Tipunin from the mid 2000's.  
              At the conclusion I may touch on related, somewhat conjectural, "logarithmic TQFTs" for quantum groups at roots of unity.

               Andrei Negut (Massachusetts institute of technology): On the trace of the affine Hecke category <br>
               Abstract: We propose a connection between the horizontal trace of the affine Hecke category and the elliptic Hall algebra, mirroring known 
               constructions for the finite Hecke category. Explicitly, we construct a family of generators of the affine Hecke category, compute certain 
               categorified commutators between them, and show that their K-theoretic shadows match certain commutators in the elliptic Hall algebra. 
               Joint work with Eugene Gorsky.
