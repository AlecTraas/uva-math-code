This workshop celebrates the work of G.T. Whyburn Professor of Mathematics <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/people/bjp8w/">Brian J. Parshall</a> and his collaborators. 
In the course of his career, together with Ed Cline and <a href="http://people.virginia.edu/~lls2l/">Leonard Scott</a> (CPS) as well as with others, Brian has made important contributions to the representation theory of algebraic and quantum groups.
The workshop is held on the occasion of Brian's retirement.
