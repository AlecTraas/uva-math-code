              <b> Ivan Losev (Yale University) </b>: Quantum category $\mathcal O$<br>
              Abstract: The representation theory of quantum groups including at roots of unity is an important part of Lie representation theory. In this talk, we will study one of categories of representations: the quantum category $\mathcal O$, which is a suitable analog of the classical Bernstein-Gelfand category $\mathcal O$. We will relate it to a model representation category, the affine Hecke category, more precisely to the heart of the new $t$-structure on that category (all these terms will be defined in the lectures). The lectures are based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03153">arXiv:2310.03153</a>.

              <b> Thomas Haines (University of Maryland) </b>: Pavings of convolution fibers and applications <br>
              Abstract: A convolution morphism is the geometric analogue of the convolution of functions in a Hecke algebra. The properties of fibers of convolution morphisms are used in a variety of ways in the geometric Langlands program and in the study of Schubert varieties.  I will explain a very general result about cellular pavings of fibers of convolution morphisms in the setting of partial affine flag varieties, as well as applications related to the very purity and parity vanishing of cohomology of Schubert varieties over finite fields, structure constants for parahoric Hecke algebras, and the (motivic) geometric Satake equivalence. The primary reference is the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14218">arXiv:2309.14218</a>.

              <b> Naihuan Jing (North Carolina State University) </b>: Characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ and vertex operators <br>
              Abstract: Irreducible characters of the finite group $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ were determined by Green in a remarkable paper that has influenced representation theory greatly. In this talk, I will discuss a vertex algebraic approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$. Green's theory is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R(G)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} R(\mathrm{GL}(n,q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. This offers a simplification to identify the Fock space $R(G)$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions. We will also discuss how to compute the characters in general. This is joint work with Y. Wu.

              <b> Kang Lu (University of Virginia) </b>: A Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangians via degeneration <br>
             Abstract: We formulate a new family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via degeneration of Drinfeld presentations of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our twisted Yangians are isomorphic to twisted Yangians constructed in RTT presentation. This is a joint work with Weiqiang Wang and Weinan Zhang.

              <b> Darlayne Addabbo (University of Arizona) </b>:Vertex Operators for Imaginary $gl_2$-subalgebras in the Monster Lie Algebra <br>
              Abstract: The Monster Lie algebra $m$ is a quotient of the physical space of the vertex algebra $V=V^\natural\otimes V_{1,1}$, where $V^\natural$ is Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman's Moonshine 
              module vertex operator algebra, and $V_{1,1}$ is the vertex algebra corresponding to the rank 2 even unimodular lattice $II_{1,1}$. I will discuss the construction of vertex algebra elements 
              that project to bases for subalgebras of $m$ isomorphic to $gl_2$ and corresponding to imaginary simple roots $(1,j)$ for $j>0$. The action of the Monster finite simple group $M$ on $V^\natural$ 
              induces an $M$-action on the set of $gl_2$ subalgebras corresponding to a fixed imaginary simple root. I will discuss this action and related open questions. (This talk is based on joint work with 
              Lisa Carbone, Elizabeth Jurisich, Maryam Khaqan, and Scott H. Murray).

              <b> Marco Aldi (Virginia Commonwealth University) </b>: Dani-Mainkar Lie Algebras and their cohomology <br>
              Abstract: The Dani-Mainkar construction associates metabelian Lie algebras to finite simple graphs. We present some recent advances, including strong homotopy generalizations for hypergraphs and 
              cohomology calculations. We also illustrate the connection to supersymmetric quantum mechanics and quantum computing.

              <b> Keshav Dahiya (Indian University Purdue University, Indianapolis) </b>: Intertwiners of representations of quantum affine algebras <br>
              Abstract: I wish to give a talk on the explicit expressions of the R-matrices acting in tensor squares of the first fundamental representations of all types of quantum affine algebras, in terms of 
              projectors related to decomposition of the tensor squares with respect to non-affine quantum algebras.

              <b> Peter Dillery (University of Maryland) </b>: Rigid inner forms and the Bernstein decomposition for L-parameters <br>
              Abstract: Let H be a (potentially disconnected) reductive group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. The main goal of this talk is to explain a new approach for constructing the
             generalized Springer correspondence for H-equivariant irreducible perverse sheaf on the nilpotent cone of H. An alternative approach to this task was first introduced by Aubert-Moussaoui-Solleveld in 
             order to construct the Bernstein decomposition for enhanced L-parameters (in the sense of Arthur)---a first step in a general strategy to reduce local Langlands correspondences to the supercuspidal case. 
             Our approach lets us construct and study the Bernstein decomposition for L-parameters in the context of Kaletha's refined local Langlands correspondence, which this talk will also discuss. This work is 
            joint with David Schwein.

              <b> Ilya Dumanski (Massachussettes Institute of Technolology) </b>: Cluster categorifications and Feigin-Loktev fusion product <br>
              Abstract: There are two different kinds of categories with cluster structure in representation theory: modules over quantum affine group (due to Hernandez-Leclerc) and perverse coherent sheaves on the 
             affine Grassmannian (due to Cautis-Williams). We show that they are in fact connected via the third category: modules over the current algebra with operation of the Feigin-Loktev fusion product. This helps
             to prove facts about one of these categories, knowing their analogs about the other. Based on arXiv:2308.05268.

              <b> Thomas Gannon (University of California, Los Angeles) </b>: Proof of the Ginzburg-Kazhdan Conjecture <br>
              Abstract: The main theorem of this talk will be that the affine closure of the cotangent bundle of the basic affine space (also known as the universal hyperkahler implosion) has symplectic singularities for
                        any reductive group, where essentially all of these terms will be defined in the course of the talk. After discussing some motivation for the theory of symplectic singularities, we will survey some
                        of the basic facts that are known about the universal hyperkahler implosion and discuss how they are used to prove the main theorem. Time permitting, we will also discuss recent joint with Harold 
                        Williams, which identifies the universal hyperkahler implosion in type A with a Coulomb branch in the sense of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima, confirming a conjectural description of Dancer, 
                        Hanany, and Kirwan.

              <b> Matthew Hamil (University of Georgia) </b>: Nilpotence via homological residue fields in stable categories of Lie superalgebra representations <br>
              Abstract: Let ${\mathfrak g}={\mathfrak g}_{0}\oplus {\mathfrak g}_{1}$ be a Type I classical Lie superalgebra with an ample detecting subalgebra ${\mathfrak f}$. In this talk, the speaker will consider the
           tensor triangular geometry for the stable category of finite-dimensional Lie superalgebra representations: $\text{stab}({\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}_{0})})$. The localizing subcategories for the 
          detecting subalgebra are classified which allows us to prove a nilpotence theorem and determine the homological spectrum for the stable module category of ${\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak f},{\mathfrak f}_{0})}$. <br>
          These results on the detecting subalgebras are then applied with work of Balmer and key assumptions in work of Boe, Kujawa and Nakano, to provide a method to explicitly realize the Balmer spectrum of 
          $\text{stab}({\mathcal F}_{({\mathfrak g},{\mathfrak g}_{0})})$ for Type I classical Lie superalgebras (with an ample detecting subalgebra).

          <b>Vijay Higgins (Michigan State University) </b>: Central elements in the SL(d) skein algebra<br>
              Abstract: The skein algebra of a surface is spanned by links in the thickened surface, subject to skein relations which diagrammatically encode the data of a quantum group. The multiplication in the 
                        algebra is induced by stacking links in the thickened surface. This product is generally noncommutative. When the quantum parameter q is generic, the center of the skein algebra is essentially
                        trivial. However, when q is a root of unity, interesting central elements arise. When the quantum group is quantum SL(2), the work of Bonahon-Wong shows that these central elements can be obtained
                        by a topological operation of threading Chebyshev polynomials along knots. In this talk, I will discuss joint work with F. Bonahon in which we use analogous multi-variable 'threading' polynomials
                        to obtain central elements in higher rank SL(d) skein algebras.

          <b>Dennis Hou (Rutgers University–New Brunswick) </b>: Quantized enveloping algebras over noncommutative rings<br>
              Abstract:  Berenstein and Retakh have defined Lie groups and algebras over arbitrary division rings in terms of ``noncommutative envelopes." Using this notion of a Lie algebra over a noncommutative ring, 
                         we can define the analogue of its universal enveloping algebra, which has the natural structure of a (left) Hopf algebroid in the sense of Böhm and Szlachányi. This will admit a Drinfeld–Jimbo 
                         quantization, the span of whose skew-primitive elements can be considered a noncommutative version of a quantum Lie algebra.

              Abstract:  A special case of certain diagrammatics, when $G$ is the group of affine transformations of a line, can be related to the infinitesimal dilogarithm and to the Shannon entropy of finite probability 
                        distributions. I will explain the diagrammatics and their connections to infinitesimal dilogarithms and entropy.

              Abstract: In this talk, we will introduce an object (which we call the Kirillov projector) that connects the topics of title. We will also show that it provides a nonstandard solution to the quantum Yang-Baxter
                        equation, a certain version of the Belavin’s R-matrix associated with stable bundles on elliptic curves.

          <b>Scott Larson (University of Georgia) </b>:   A Family of Irreducible Characteristic Cycles for U(p,q)<br>
              Abstract: Fibers of resolutions of singularities have many connections to representation theory, for example, Springer’s resolution and Weyl groups. In the case of real reductive groups, we have resolutions 
                        of singularities of K-orbit closures in flag varieties. It was shown by Larson–Romanov that cohomology of fibers are related to Kazhdan–Lusztig–Vogan polynomials. In joint work with Bill Graham 
                        and Minyoung Jeon, we analyze further the algebraic geometry of these resolutions. We prove that a family of small resolutions for U(p,q) have reduced scheme theoretic fibers. We furthermore prove 
                        that the corresponding Harish-Chandra modules for U(p,q) have irreducible characteristic cycles.

          <b>Melody Molander (University of California, Santa Barbara) </b>:   Skein Theory for Index 4 Subfactor Planar Algebras<br>
              Abstract: Subfactor planar algebras first were constructed by Vaughan Jones as a diagrammatic axiomatization of the standard invariant of a subfactor. These planar algebras also encode two other invariants of 
                          the subfactors: the index and the principal graph. The Kuperberg Program asks to find all diagrammatic presentations of subfactor planar algebras. This program has been completed for index less than 4. 
                          In this talk, I will introduce subfactor planar algebras and give some presentations of subfactor planar algebras of index 4 which have affine ADE Dynkin diagrams as their principal graphs.
