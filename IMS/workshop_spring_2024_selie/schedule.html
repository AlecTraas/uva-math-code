              <b> Ivan Losev (Yale University) </b>: Quantum category $\mathcal O$<br>
              Abstract: The representation theory of quantum groups including at roots of unity is an important part of Lie representation theory. In this talk, we will study one of categories of representations: the quantum category $\mathcal O$, which is a suitable analog of the classical Bernstein-Gelfand category $\mathcal O$. We will relate it to a model representation category, the affine Hecke category, more precisely to the heart of the new $t$-structure on that category (all these terms will be defined in the lectures). The lectures are based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03153">arXiv:2310.03153</a>.

              <b> Naihuan Jing (North Carolina State University) </b>: Characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ and vertex operators <br>
              Abstract: Irreducible characters of the finite group $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ were determined by Green in a remarkable paper that has influenced representation theory greatly. In this talk, I will discuss a vertex algebraic approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$. Green's theory is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R(G)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} R(GL(n,q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. This offers a simplification to identify the Fock space $R(G)$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions. We will also discuss how to compute the characters in general. This is joint work with Y. Wu.

              <b> Kang Lu (University of Virginia) </b>: A Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangians via degeneration <br>
             Abstract: We formulate a new family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via degeneration of Drinfeld presentations of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our twisted Yangians are isomorphic to twisted Yangians constructed in RTT presentation. This is a joint work with Weiqiang Wang and Weinan Zhang.
