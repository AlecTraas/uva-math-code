             <li>
              <b> Ivan Losev (Yale University) </b>: Quantum category $\mathcal O$<br>
              Abstract: The representation theory of quantum groups including at roots of unity is an important part of Lie representation theory. In this talk, we will study one of categories of representations: the quantum category $\mathcal O$, which is a suitable analog of the classical Bernstein-Gelfand category $\mathcal O$. We will relate it to a model representation category, the affine Hecke category, more precisely to the heart of the new $t$-structure on that category (all these terms will be defined in the lectures). The lectures are based on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03153">arXiv:2310.03153</a>.

            <li>
              <b> Thomas Haines (University of Maryland) </b>: Pavings of convolution fibers and applications <br>
              Abstract: A convolution morphism is the geometric analogue of the convolution of functions in a Hecke algebra. The properties of fibers of convolution morphisms are used in a variety of ways in the geometric Langlands program and in the study of Schubert varieties.  I will explain a very general result about cellular pavings of fibers of convolution morphisms in the setting of partial affine flag varieties, as well as applications related to the very purity and parity vanishing of cohomology of Schubert varieties over finite fields, structure constants for parahoric Hecke algebras, and the (motivic) geometric Satake equivalence. The primary reference is the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14218">arXiv:2309.14218</a>.

              <b> Naihuan Jing (North Carolina State University) </b>: Characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ and vertex operators <br>
              Abstract: Irreducible characters of the finite group $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$ were determined by Green in a remarkable paper that has influenced representation theory greatly. In this talk, I will discuss a vertex algebraic approach to construct and compute all complex irreducible characters of $\mathrm{GL}(n, q)$. Green's theory is recovered and enhanced under the realization of the Grothendieck ring of representations $R(G)=\bigoplus_{n\geqslant 0} R(\mathrm{GL}(n,q))$ as two isomorphic Fock spaces. Under this picture, the irreducible characters are realized by the Bernstein vertex operators for Schur functions, the characteristic functions of the conjugacy classes are realized by the vertex operators for the Hall-Littlewood functions, and the character table is completely given by matrix coefficients of vertex operators of these two types. This offers a simplification to identify the Fock space $R(G)$ as the Hall algebra of symmetric functions. We will also discuss how to compute the characters in general. This is joint work with Y. Wu.

              <b> Kang Lu (University of Virginia) </b>: A Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangians via degeneration <br>
             Abstract: We formulate a new family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of split type) in current generators and relations, via degeneration of Drinfeld presentations of affine $\imath$quantum groups (associated with split Satake diagrams). These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras. For type AI, it matches with the Drinfeld presentation of twisted Yangian obtained via Gauss decomposition. We conjecture that our twisted Yangians are isomorphic to twisted Yangians constructed in RTT presentation. This is a joint work with Weiqiang Wang and Weinan Zhang.

            <li>
              <b> Darlayne Addabbo (University of Arizona) </b>:Vertex Operators for Imaginary $gl_2$-subalgebras in the Monster Lie Algebra <br>
              Abstract: The Monster Lie algebra $m$ is a quotient of the physical space of the vertex algebra $V=V^\natural\otimes V_{1,1}$, where $V^\natural$ is Frenkel, Lepowsky, and Meurman's Moonshine 
              module vertex operator algebra, and $V_{1,1}$ is the vertex algebra corresponding to the rank 2 even unimodular lattice $II_{1,1}$. I will discuss the construction of vertex algebra elements 
              that project to bases for subalgebras of $m$ isomorphic to $gl_2$ and corresponding to imaginary simple roots $(1,j)$ for $j>0$. The action of the Monster finite simple group $M$ on $V^\natural$ 
              induces an $M$-action on the set of $gl_2$ subalgebras corresponding to a fixed imaginary simple root. I will discuss this action and related open questions. (This talk is based on joint work with 
              Lisa Carbone, Elizabeth Jurisich, Maryam Khaqan, and Scott H. Murray).

              <b> Marco Aldi (Virginia Commonwealth University) </b>: Dani-Mainkar Lie Algebras and their cohomology <br>
              Abstract: The Dani-Mainkar construction associates metabelian Lie algebras to finite simple graphs. We present some recent advances, including strong homotopy generalizations for hypergraphs and 
              cohomology calculations. We also illustrate the connection to supersymmetric quantum mechanics and quantum computing.

              <b> Keshav Dahiya (Indian University Purdue University, Indianapolis) </b>: Intertwiners of representations of quantum affine algebras <br>
              Abstract: I wish to give a talk on the explicit expressions of the R-matrices acting in tensor squares of the first fundamental representations of all types of quantum affine algebras, in terms of 
              projectors related to decomposition of the tensor squares with respect to non-affine quantum algebras.
