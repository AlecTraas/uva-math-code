        We will be able to provide financial support through an NSF Conference grant to some of the participants.
        The support will be primarily directed towards PhD students, early career researchers, and 
        members of underrepresented groups.
        <p class="mt-2">
        To request financial support, please:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Register and indicate the financial support request 
                in the registration form below.

            </li>
            <li>
                If you are a PhD candidate, have your advisor send a short
                recommendation letter (1 page limit)
                to {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="wbt4qn" %} or {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="yq2dw" %}
