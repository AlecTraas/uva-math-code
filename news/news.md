(under construction)

This will be a general roll of news,
and there will be special pages for news by category, e.g.

- math bulletin
- conferences
- awards
- general news
- also the IMS lectures will be posted here; and maybe their news roll will go to the IMS part

News are all these things, and all other non-seminar or seminar-of-general-interest activity
