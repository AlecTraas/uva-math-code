### Who are we?

<span align="justify"> The <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/awmmath/home">Association for Women in Mathematics</a> is a national organization whose goals are encouraging women and girls to study and to have active careers in the mathematical sciences, and promoting equal opportunity and  equal treatment of women and girls in the mathematical sciences.
We are the student chapter of the AWM at the University of Virginia. Our goal is to provide for all students, regardless of gender identity, to be exposed to the world of professional mathematics, to obtain information about the varied career options in mathematics, to network with professional mathematicians, and to develop leadership skills.
