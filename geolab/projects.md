### Spring 2024

+ Knots: Spirographs, Wire, Clay
    - Mentors: Sarah Blackwell, Jiajun Yan
    - Mentees: Sharini Rahman, Ethan Wu
    - Description: We explored mathematical knots through various different media such as spirographs, wire, clay, and yarn. We investigated the types of knots that can arise from spirograph curves, and also used wire, clay, and yarn to make 3D models of the knots we discussed.

+ Zome
    - Mentors: Zivile Puospekaite, Brandon Shapiro
    - Mentees: Cassie Buxbaum, Jai Khosla, Alice Zhang, Melissa Zheng
    - Description: We explored 3-dimensional polyhedra and 4-dimensional polytopes using Zome to build models of many of these shapes, compute various angles within them, and reason about their existence. In particular, we used Zome to see why there are only 5 3-d platonic solids and 6 in 4-d, and worked towards figuring out how to count the number of faces of the 4-d solids.

+ Paper
    - Mentors: David Chasteen-Boyd, Mason Hart
    - Mentees: Anthony Doll, Lucia Dwyer, Wynn Smith
    - Description: We explored 2-dimensional geometry and topology through (2-dimensional) paper. Topics included tilings of the plane, platonic solids, Euler characteristic, and gluing diagrams for surfaces. Our main project was exploring the classification of surfaces by cutting and manipulating paper gluing diagrams. In the end, we described an algorithm for this cutting and gluing.

+ Computational Geometry
    - Mentors: Lam Nguyen, Alec Traaseth
    - Mentees: Kai Garcia-Lorincz, Mitansh Kagalwala, Ridge Redding, Matthew Schlueter, Anna Tu
    - Description: We explored algorithms in computational geometry including convex hulls, Voronoi diagrams, and Delauney triangulations and coded them in Python. Students undertook individual capstone projects that included topics such as orthogonal range searching, line-segment intersection, Page rank, and hyperbolic convex hulls. We also had one final project to explore Djistraka’s algorithm.

### Fall 2023

+ Spirographs
    - Mentors: Sarah Blackwell, Zivile Puospekaite
    - Mentees: Kayla Denoo, Erol Guleyupoglu, George Hammer, Yuhong Liu
    - Description: We explored the mathematics of spirographs, which involved investigating the properties of the curves produced in our drawings and deriving parametric equations for these curves.

+ Zome
    - Mentors: Oscar Arévalo, Brandon Shapiro
    - Mentees: Sarah Child, Paris Phan, Ili Rong, Nahli Zzaman
    - Description: We explored 3-dimensional polyhedra and 4-dimensional polytopes using Zome to build models of many of these shapes, compute various angles within them, and reason about their existence. In particular, we used Zome to see why there are only 5 3-d platonic solids and 6 in 4-d, and pursued questions about duality and symmetry of these solids.

+ Paper
    - Mentors: David Chasteen-Boyd, Biying Wang
    - Mentees: Baz DeVaul, Justin Gu, Jae Wan Jung, Wynn Smith
    - Description: We started the semester exploring various constructions that can be done with origami, including visual representations of cyclic groups and their subgroups, trisecting an angle, and approximating a parabola. The latter half of the semester was focused on studying properties of surfaces by constructing models of them with modular origami.

+ Wire
    - Mentors: Lam Nguyen, Alec Traaseth
    - Mentees: Brandon Bennett, Samuel Bromberg, Grace Coleman, Casey Matney, Ridge Redding
    - Description: We explored various models of the hyperbolic plane and isometries between them using wire constructions and string.
