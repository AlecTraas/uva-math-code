<h2 class="mb-3">Geometry Lab</h2>

The Geometry Lab is a mentoring and research opportunity for students interested in experiencing Mathematics in a more hands-on way. Undergraduate students are paired with graduate students or postdocs for a semester-long project. See the projects page for examples of projects which have run in the past. During the semesters there are various opportunities for the different groups to interact and for presenting the ideas behind the project to a wider community, like high school students from the Star Hill Pathway program, other undergraduate students from the AWM Student Chapter or Math Club, and also the Charlottesville community at the local Farmers Market. The mentors suggest general projects or media to use, but the details on the work will be decided together with the students.

This program allows students to learn and understand subjects not usually covered in the classes currently offered by the department. In addition, the students learn how to use hands-on activities to learn how to ask questions and start answering those questions which is exactly what research in mathematics is about, so for students interested in pursuing undergraduate research this is a great first step, together with the Directed Reading Program. This program is also a great way to see if a math major is right for you.
