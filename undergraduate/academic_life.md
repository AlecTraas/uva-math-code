### Competitions

<p>The<strong> William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition</strong> is an annual mathematics competition for undergraduate college students enrolled at institutions of higher learning in the United States and Canada. It awards scholarships with cash prizes ranging from $250 to $2,500 for the top students and $5,000 to $25,000 for the top schools, plus the top ten individual scores get tuition waived at Harvard, and the top 100 individual scores have their names mentioned by rank to leading universities. It is considered by many to be the most prestigious university-level mathematics examination in the world. The competition was founded in 1927 by Elizabeth Lowell Putnam in memory of her husband William Lowell Putnam, who was an advocate of intercollegiate intellectual competition. The exam has been offered annually since 1938 and is administered by the Mathematical Association of America.&nbsp; Contact: Thomas Koberda (<a href="mailto:tmk5a@virginia.edu">tmk5a@virginia.edu</a>).</p>

### Math Club

The Undergraduate Math Club at University of Virginia is a weekly seminar and a club for students interested in mathematics and related areas. An up-to-date calendar of meetings is [here]({{site.url}}/seminars/mathclub/). The Math Club is a students' space having an official UVA CIO status (a student-lead organization). This provides the Club with a student managing board which helps plan and organize events. {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="aso9t" %} and {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="sm4cw" %} are the faculty coordinators of the Club for the 2017-18 academic year.

The activities at the Math Club include, but are not limited to:

- talks by math faculty and graduate students, from the UVA Math Department, or visiting here
- math-related talks by people from other UVA departments (for example, Physics or Philosophy)
- presentations by local math-related industry companies
- presentations by undergraduate students on their research projects, activities, or something they find interesting
- panel discussions (for example, on REUs, or on careers for math majors)
- outside trips (such as to a math-related movie, or to the UVA 3D printing lab)
- organization of [MMATHS](http://www.mmaths.org/), a nation-wide competition for high school students co-hosted at UVA

### AWM

[Association for Women in Mathematics Student Chapter at the University of Virginia]({{site.url}}/awm/).

The goal of the AWM Student Chapter at UVA is to support and encourage women in Mathematics, building a community of people who like Math, open to everyone, not just women. There are several activities planned for this year, including Math talks, a mentorship program, and panels on topics like research opportunities or grad school.
