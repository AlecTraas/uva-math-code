<h1 class="mb-4">Diagnostic</h1>

<p>We are excited that you are interested in taking a math class at UVA! It’s important to find a good starting place so that we can best support your learning.  We have a couple of questions to help you figure out what’s next. </p>

## What Math courses do I need?
<p> First, you will want to think about what major you are considering and the courses you will be taking. <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/diagnosticCourses">Here's a list</a> of some majors and courses they require. </p>
<h3 class="mb-4">Three pathways through our introductory courses</h3>
<ol class="diagnostic">
  <li> <b>Path 1</b>  Non-calculus based courses for someone needing to fulfill a quantitative reasoning requirement and don’t need a calculus based course for their major. We offer MATH 1110: Probability/Finite Mathematics , MATH 1140 Financial Mathematics, MATH 1150 The Shape of Space, and   MATH 1160 Algebra, Number Systems and Number Theory. <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> has more complete descriptions of each of these courses. </li>
  
  <li>  <b>Path 2</b>  Are you interested in business, biology, a social science or need to fulfill  premed requirements?  This pathway includes Differential and Integral Calculus for non-STEM majors. We offer Math 1190, 1210, and 1220 for this path. See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Math 1190 is a 4 credit course designed to provide a gentle introduction to Survey of Calculus 1 with addtional pre-calculus and algebra practice.  This is a great course if it's been awhile since your last math course and/or you would like to brush up on your pre-calculus and/or algebra skills.  </li>
    <li>Math 1210, Survey of Calculus 1, is a 3 credit course designed to answer the question "How do we describe how things change?" for non-STEM majors.  This is sometimes called <i>Differential Calculus</i>.  </li>
      <li>Math 1220, Survey of Calculus 2, is a 3 credit course designed to answer the question "What happens when we accumulate an infinite number of quantities?"  for non-STEM majors. This is sometimes called <i>Integral Calculus</i>.  See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
  </ul>
   
  <li> <b>Path 3</b>  Are you interested in one of the natural sciences, engineering, mathematics or doing graduate work in one of the social sciences?  This pathway includes Differential and Integral Calculus. We offer Math 1310, 1320 and Math 2310 for this path. See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Math 1310, Calculus 1, is a 4 credit course designed to answer the question "How do we describe how things change?"  for STEM majors. This is sometimes called <i>Differential Calculus</i></li>
      <li>Math 1320, Calculus 2, is a 4 credit course designed to answer the question "What happens when we accumulate an infinite number of quantities?"  for STEM majors.  This is sometimes called <i>Integral Calculus</i></li>
      <li>Math 2310, Calculus 3, is a 4 credit course designed to answer the question "What does Calculus look like in higher dimensions?"  for STEM majors.  This is sometimes called <i>Multivariable Calculus</i></li>
  </ul>
  </ol>

## Diagnostic: What course is the best place to start?  
<ol>
  <li>Is <b>Path 1</b> the best choice for you? Feel free to sign up for the course that most interests you!</li>
   <li>Is <b>Path 2</b> the best choice for you?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>If you have not taken a calculus course before, or it's been quite awhile, Math 1190 or Math 1210 is probably your best starting point.</li>
      <li>If you are trying to decide between Math 1210 and Math 1220 do these three things: 
        <ol>
          <li>Take this self-paced Diagnostic. It's best not to use a calculator.</li>
          <li>Check your answers  with this solution guide.</li>
          <li>Use this advice to decide which course to take.</li>
        </ol>
