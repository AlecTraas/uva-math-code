<h1 class="mb-4">Diagnostic</h1>

<p>We are excited that you are interested in taking a math class at UVA! It’s important to find a good starting place so that we can best support your learning.  We have a couple of questions to help you figure out what’s next. </p>

### What Math courses do I need?
<p> First, you will want to think about what major you are considering and the courses you will be taking. <a href="diagnosticCourses.md">Here's a list</a> of some majors and courses they require We have three pathways in our introductory courses.
<ol>
  <li> <b>Path 1</b>  Non-calculus based courses for someone needing to fulfill a quantitative reasoning requirement and don’t need a calculus based course for their major. We offer MATH 1110: Probability/Finite Mathematics , MATH 1140 Financial Mathematics, MATH 1150 The Shape of Space, and   MATH 1160 Algebra, Number Systems and Number Theory. <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> has more complete descriptions of each of these courses. </li>
  <li>  <b>Path 2</b>  Differential and Integral Calculus for non-STEM majors. We offer Math 1190, 1210, and 1220 for this path. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Math 1190 is a 4 credit course designed to provide a gentle introduction to Survey of Calculus 1 with addtional pre-calculus and algebra practice.  This is a great course if it's been awhile since your last math course and/or you would like to brush up on your pre-calculus and/or algebra skills.  See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
    <li>Math 1210, Survey of Calculus 1, is a 3 credit course designed to answer the question "How do we describe how things change?"  This is sometimes called <i>Differential Calculus</i>.  See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
      <li>Math 1220, Survey of Calculus 2, is a 3 credit course designed to answer the question "What happens when we accumulate an infinite number of quantities?"  This is sometimes called <i>Integral Calculus</i>.  See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
  </ul>
    <li> <b>Path 3</b>  Differential and Integral Calculus for STEM majors. We offer Math 1310 and 1320 for this path.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Math 1310, Calculus 1, is a 4 credit course designed to answer the question "How do we describe how things change?"  This is sometimes called <i>Differential Calculus</i></li>
      <li>Math 1320, Calculus 2, is a 4 credit course designed to answer the question "What happens when we accumulate an infinite number of quantities?"  This is sometimes called <i>Integral Calculus</i></li>
  </ul>
  </ol>
