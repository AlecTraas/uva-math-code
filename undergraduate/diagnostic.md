<p>We are excited that you are interested in taking a math class at UVA! It’s important to find a good starting place so that we can best support your learning.  We have a couple of questions to help you figure out what’s next. </p>

### What Math courses do I need?
<p> First, you will want to think about what major you are considering and the courses you will be taking.  We have three pathways in our introductory courses.
<ol>
  <li>Non-calculus based courses for someone needing to fulfill a quantitative reasoning requirement and don’t need a calculus based course for their major. We offer MATH 1110: Probability/Finite Mathematics , MATH 1140 Financial Mathematics, MATH 1150 The Shape of Space, and   MATH 1160 Algebra, Number Systems and Number Theory </li>
  <li>Differential and Integral Calculus for non-STEM majors. We offer Math 1190, 1210, and 1220 for this path. </li>
    <li>Differential and Integral Calculus for STEM majors. We offer Math 1310 and 1320 for this path.</li>
