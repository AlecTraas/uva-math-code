BEFORE JOINING A SESSION (by clicking on the appropriate link below): Make sure you have a PNG, JPEG, or PDF file containing the statement(s) of the problem(s) you wish to discuss with a consultant.  The file should provide some white space below the problem statement where you and the consultant can record annotations.  The file might be created via screen shots.  Here's a sample file. 

When you enter a session have your problem(s) file open on your computer (and ideally no other windows open other than the browser window displaying this schedule).  The consultant may ask you to share your screen to facilitate discussion of the problem.  Your consultant also may ask you to share your problem(s) file using Zoom's Chat Tool (sharing instructions).   When you enter a Zoom room for Calc I & II,  a consultant will assign you to a Calculus I breakout room or Calculus II room, depending on what course you are in.  The assignment process may take up to a minute.
