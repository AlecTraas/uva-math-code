<h1 class="mb-4">Diagnostic for Path 2</h1>

<p> We offer Math 1190, 1210, and 1220 for Path 2 </p>
<div class=diagnostic>
 <ul>
    <li> <span class="bolded">Math 1190</span>, Survey of Calculus 1 with Algebra is a <strong>4</strong> credit course designed to provide a gentle introduction to Survey of Calculus 1 with addtional pre-calculus and algebra practice.  This is a great course if it's been awhile since your last math course and/or you would like to brush up on your pre-calculus and/or algebra skills.  </li>
    <li> <span class="bolded">Math 1210</span>, Survey of Calculus 1, is a <strong>3</strong> credit course designed to answer the question "How do we describe how things change?" for non-STEM majors.  This is sometimes called <i>Differential Calculus</i>.  </li>
      <li> <span class="bolded">Math 1220</span>, Survey of Calculus 2, is a <strong>3</strong> credit course designed to answer the question "What happens when we accumulate an infinite number of quantities?"  for non-STEM majors. This is sometimes called <i>Integral Calculus</i>.  See  <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a> for more details.</li>
  </ul>
  
  

 <span class="bolded"> <a href=" https://louslist.org/CC/Mathematics.html">Lou's List</a></span> has more complete descriptions of each of these courses.

 ## Diagnostic: Which course is the best place to start?  
 
 <ol>
    <li><em>Have you <strong>not</strong> taken calculus course before?  Has it been quite awhile since your last calculus course?</em> </li>
    <ul><li>Math 1190 or Math 1210 is probably your best starting point.</li></ul>
   
    <li><em> Would it be helpful to brush up or get more practice with Algebra and/or Pre-Calculus?</em> </li>
     <ul>
     <li>if 'yes' is your answer, then 1190 Would be a great environment to do this. </li>
     <li>if 'no' is your answer then Math 1210 would be a good fit. 
    </ul>
  
    <li> <em> Are you trying to decide betwen Math 1210 and Math 1220?</em> You will need to do 3 things.
