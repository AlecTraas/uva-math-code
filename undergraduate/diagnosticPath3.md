<p> We offer Math 1310, and Math 1320, and Math 2310 for Path 3 </p>

 <ul>
    <li> <span class="bolded">Math 1310</span>, Calculus 1, is a <strong>4</strong> credit course designed to answer the question "How do we describe how things change?" for STEM majors.  This is sometimes called <em>Differential Calculus</em>.  </li>
    <li> <span class="bolded">Math 1320</span>, Calculus 2, is a <strong>4</strong> credit course designed to answer the question "What happens when we accumulate an infinite number of quantities?"  for STEM majors. This is sometimes called <em>Integral Calculus</em>.  </li>
    <li> <span class="bolded">Math 2310</span>, Calculus 2, is a <strong>4</strong> credit course designed to answer the question "What does Calculus look like in higher dimensions?"  for STEM majors. This is sometimes called <em>Multivariable Calculus</em>.  </li>
</ul>
