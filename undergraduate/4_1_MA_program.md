<h1 class="mb-3">4+1 (or 3+1) BA/MA Program</h1>

<p>Information on the 5-year Master&#39;s Program:<br />
<br />
&mdash;It offers streamlined admission to the graduate school for the purpose of obtaining a master&rsquo;s degree after 1 additional year at UVa.<br />
<br />
&mdash;You would be able to apply up to 6 credits of graduate math courses you took during your 4 undergraduate years toward the master&rsquo;s requirements (30 credits), if you did not use them toward your bachelor&rsquo;s. This is what can allow you to finish the master&rsquo;s in only 2 additional semesters; it also saves you 6 credits of graduate tuition.<br />
<br />
&mdash;The program is &ldquo;terminal,&rdquo; meaning that you would not be eligible to continue toward a doctoral degree without going through the usual, full admission process.<br />
<br />
&mdash;There is no online application, application fee, GRE test requirement, or recommendation letter required.<br />
<br />
If you think you may be interested in the program, I suggest you meet with your math advisor. Together you can discuss whether the program is suitable for you, and verify that your schedule will accommodate it. Note that interested students&rsquo; transcripts will be reviewed by the graduate committee in the mathematics department prior to their acceptance, and an endorsement from your advisor will be helpful in reaching a decision.<br />
<br />
I also suggest you review the requirements for the master&rsquo;s degree, which can be found here: [`www.math.virginia.edu/graduate/requirements`](www.math.virginia.edu/graduate/requirements)<br />
<br />
Finally, note that ONLY 6 credits of graduate work that you took while officially an undergraduate can count toward the master&rsquo;s. In some cases, this might mean that to make the program work efficiently for you, you would need to graduate (from the bachelor&rsquo;s program) early.</p>
