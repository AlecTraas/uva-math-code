<h1 class="mb-4">Diagnostic Advice for 1320/2310</h1>

<p> Now that you've taken  <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/placement-files/diagnostic_1320_2310.html">the diagnostic</a> to decide between Math 1310 and Math 1320  </p>

 <ul>
    <li> Grade diagnostic problems as either right or wrong <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/placement-files/ExamC_Solutions.pdf">using these solutions</a>. If you arrived at an incorrect solution owing only to a careless arithmetic error, then count the solution as correct. </li>
    <li> <strong>If fewer than seven problems answered correctly</strong>, and you have credit for Math 1310 OR did well on the 1310/1320 diagnostic,  you should enroll in Math 1320.  </li>
      <li> <strong>If seven or more problems are  answered correctly</strong>, you are confident in your foundation for <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/placement-files/1320.html">Math 1320 topics</a>, are willing to tackle  <a href="https://math.virginia.edu/undergraduate/placement-files/2310.html">Math 2310 topics</a> then you should enroll in Math 2310 and/or consider enrolling in Math 3250, Differential Equations.</li>
  	 <li> <strong>If seven or more problems are  answered correctly</strong>, but you think you would benefit from a stronger foundation in Math 1320, then by all means come an join us in Math 1320!</li>
  	 <li><strong>If seven or more problems are  answered correctly</strong>,If you are exceptionally confident that you are prepared for Calculus 3, you should consider enrolling in Math 2315 (see below).</li>  	 
  </ul>

    	 <p style="margin-left: 30px;" ><span class="bolded">Math 2315 and Math 3250.</span> The Mathematics Department has recently developed two courses to be taken (optionally) instead of Math 2310, Multivariable Calculus. These are Math 2315 (Advanced Calculus and Linear Algebra I)  and Math 3315 (Advanced Calculus and Linear Algebra II).  These courses cover the usual material in Multivariable Calculus at a deeper level and, in addition, cover linear algebra and differential equations. Success in these courses (B- or better) exempts the student from the math major requirement of taking Linear Algebra, Math 3351 and Ordinary Differential Equations, Math 3250. While a student can choose to take just Math 2315, exemption from Linear Algebra and ODE requires success in both courses.</p>
