    The Probability Seminar is the place to see talks on active research topics in probability theory, as well as informal discussions of basic notions of probability.  We typically have invited speakers every 2-3 weeks presenting a wide array of research in probability. Most other weeks are informal discussions led by local participants, often graduate students discussing recently studied topics. The seminar is open to all. Feel free to attend regularly or occasionally. [Please see the online schedule for upcoming talks. You can also let the organizers know if you would like to be on the mailing list.]
