    The Geometry Seminar talks usually focus on aspects of low-dimensional topology and geometry, including knot theory and categorification, Floer homology, 3- and 4-dimensional manifolds, and symplectic and contact topology. The lectures are often given by outside speakers, however UVa graduate students and faculty give talks as well.

    The Mathematical Physics Seminar features talks on a wide variety of topics such as, for instance, Schrödinger operators, the mathematics of quantum systems, statistical mechanics, the renormalization group and quantum field theory. Lectures typically are of research level and are given by local as well as outside speakers. Graduate students in mathematical physics are encouraged to give presentations at this seminar about their ongoing research. Everyone is welcome to attend.

    The Probability Seminar is the place to see talks on active research topics in probability theory, as well as informal discussions of basic notions of probability.  We typically have invited speakers every 2-3 weeks presenting a wide array of research in probability. Most other weeks are informal discussions led by local participants, often graduate students discussing recently studied topics. The seminar is open to all. Feel free to attend regularly or occasionally.
