<h1 class="mb-5">Collaborative Research Projects</h1>

The geometry/topology group is organizing several ongoing collaborative research projects. Our goal is to involve faculty, postdocs, and 
graduate students from mainly colleges and universities in the Virginia region, in substantial front-line mathematical research in geometry
and topology. Projects will be led by senior researchers; the first round of projects started off in summer of 2022 with an intense retreat 
workshop. The currently active projects fall within the realm of algebraic topology; upcoming projects will focus in geometry or geometric
topology.

#### Collaborative Workshop in Algebraic Topology
August 1-5, 2022

The goal of this workshop was to bring together researchers at various career stages in the Mid-Atlantic region working in the area of 
algebraic topology, with the aim of fostering collaborations.  Each of three teams has two team leaders who develop a research 
idea, and three participants who learn background material in advance of the workshop.  Each team will continue to work 
after the workshop itself and write a paper on their results.  

The workshop took place at Good Place Farms in Lexington, Virginia, and was supported by the Geometry and Topology RTG grant.
