      <summary>Naturality issues in involutive Heegaard Floer homology
      </summary>
      <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">  Heegaard Floer homology is an invariant of 3-manifolds, and knots and links within them, introduced by P. Oszváth and Z. Szabó in the early 2000s. Because of its relative computability by the standards of gauge and Floer theoretic invariants, it has enjoyed considerably popularity. However, it is not immediately obvious from the construction that Heegaard Floer homology is natural, that is, that it assigns to a basepointed 3-manifold a well-defined module over an appropriate base ring rather than an isomorphism class of modules, and well-defined cobordism maps to 4-manifolds with boundary. This situation was improved in the 2010s when A. Juhász, D. Thurston, and I. Zemke showed naturality of the various versions of Heegaard Floer homology. In this talk we consider involutive Heegaard Floer homology, a refinement of the theory introduced by C. Manolescu and I in 2015, whose definition relies on Juhász-Thurston-Zemke naturality but which is itself not obviously natural even given their results. We prove that involutive Heegaard Floer homology is a natural invariant of basepointed 3-manifolds together with a framing of the basepoint, and has well-defined maps associated to cobordisms, and discuss some consequences and implications. This is joint work with J. Hom, M. Stoffregen, and I. Zemke.</div>

      <summary>Some variations of Khovanov homology for null homologous links in RP^3
      </summary>
      <div style="background-color:#d9c9c9; padding:10px">  In this talk, I will describe two variations of Khovanov homology for null homologous links in RP^3 from two different perspectives: First, we will introduce a Bar-Natan deformation of the homology theory and define the corresponding s-invariant, which provides a genus bound for a certain class of slice surfaces. Second, we will explore an extension of the Ozsváth-Szabó spectral sequence on Heegaard Floer homology of branched double covers for null homologous links in RP^3, and generalize the E_2 page of it. </div>

                    The Nonvanishing decision problem asks if a coefficient of a polynomial is nonzero. Work of C. Monical, N. Tokcan and the speaker explicated that many polynomials in algebraic combinatorics admit combinatorial counting rules and enjoy having "saturated Newton polytopes". Therefore, in amenable cases, Nonvanishing is in the complexity class of problems with "good characterizations". This suggests a new algebraic combinatorics paradigm for complexity theory. The talk will focus on the case of Schubert polynomials, a basis of all polynomials. These appear in the study of cohomology rings of flag varieties. We give a handy tableau criterion for Nonvanishing, from which we deduce the first polynomial time algorithm. This is based on joint work with Anshul Adve and Colleen Robichaux.

      <summary>Four-genus bounds from the 10/8+4 theorem
      </summary>
     <div style="background-color:#DCEDC8; padding:10px">  Donald and Vafaee constructed a knot slicing obstruction for knots in the three-sphere by producing a bound relating the signature and second Betti number of a spin 4-manifold whose boundary is zero-surgery on the knot. Their bound relies on Furuta's 10/8 theorem and can be improved with the 10/8 + 4 theorem of Hopkins, Lin, Shi, and Xu. I will explain how to expand on this technique to obtain four-ball genus bounds and compute the bounds for some satellite knots. This is joint work in progress with Sashka Kjuchukova and Gordana Matic.</div>
