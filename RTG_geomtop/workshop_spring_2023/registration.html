<div class="row">
    <div class="col-12">
        It is confirmed that we will be able to provide financial support through an NSF Conference grant to some of the participants who wish to attend
        the workshop and possibly the <a href="{{site.url}}/ims/lectures/mikhail-khovanov/">Virginia Mathematics Lectures by Mikhail Khovanov</a>. 
        Junior researchers may request reimbursement of their travel and lodging expenses to attend the conference. 
        The support will be primarily directed towards PhD students, early career researchers, and 
        members of underrepresented groups.
        <p class="mt-2">
        To request financial support:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Register and indicate the financial support request 
                in the registration form below. 
                Answer the additional questions in the "NSF reporting" section.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you are a PhD student, have your advisor send a short
                recommendation letter (1 page limit)
                to {% include person_info_email_only.html UVA_id="yq2dw" %}
            </li>
        </ul> 
        The deadline to request financial support is March 14, 2022.
