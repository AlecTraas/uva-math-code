#### Geometry/Topology Reading Courses

Each semester one or more geometry/topology faculty and/or postdocs organize a seminar-style reading course for
graduate students. Usually these courses center around a book or collection of articles, which students study on their own
and present in course meetings. 

###### Fall 2019

_Floer Theory_: The first few weeks will be spent on chapters 1-4 of Audin and Damien's book _Morse Theory and Floer
Homology_, which develops the construction of (cellular) homology of a manifold from a Morse function.
Subsequently students will independently learn about one or more versions of Floer homology: possibilities include continuing
in Audin-Damien to learn Hamiltonian Floer homology, related notions such as Floer homology for symplectomorphisms or for
Lagrangian intersections, or more diverse incarnations like symplectic homology, contact homology, instanton Floer homology,
monopole Floer homology, Heegaard Floer homology, and variations of these for knots in 3-dimensional manifolds. 
Organizer: Tom Mark.
