<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry/Topology Reading Courses</h1>

Each semester one or more geometry/topology faculty or postdocs organize a seminar-style reading course for
graduate students. Usually these courses center around a book or collection of articles, which students study on their own
and present in course meetings. Current courses are listed below; more information can be found by contacting the organizer. 

Students are encouraged to suggest topics for future reading courses!

###### Spring 2022

**Stable Homotopy and Low-dimensional Topology** For some time now, there have been increasing interactions between low-dimensional 
topology and stable homotopy theory. Smooth topology in low dimensions is in some sense the opposite of the "stable regime", so this
interaction is somewhat indirect. This seminar will focus on the path between the two fields that passes through gauge theory, particularly 
Seiberg-Witten theory, which involves the study of vector bundles, connections, and curvature.  Roughly, one uses the differential geometry 
\to construct a homotopy-theoretic object associated to a given smooth 3- or 4-dimensional manifold, such as an element of a stable homotopy 
group, or a spectrum in the sense of homotopy theory, whose properties reflect subtle aspects of the differential topology of the original 
manifold.

As this involves ideas from a wide swath of topology and geometry, a goal of the seminar will be to introduce participants to topics they 
are not familiar with; it is not anticipated that anyone will be expert, or even conversant, with everything mentioned above.

As a starting point, we will study the paper of Bauer and Furuta that introduces the stable homotopy refinement of the Seiberg-Witten 
invariant for 4-manifolds; then progress to the work of Manolescu constructing a ``Seiberg-Witten-Floer homotopy type'' for 3-manifolds.  
Options abound for further reading, including a variety of quite recent results and applications.

###### Past Courses

###### Fall 2021
**Moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and the Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence**   Followed
<a href="http://irma.math.unistra.fr/~guichard/assets/files/intro-bdle-ims.pdf">lecture notes by Guichard</a>. Organizers: Sara Maloni and Tom Mark

**Invariants of 4-manifolds from Khovanov homology** Studied a new invariant, informally known as the "skein lasagne module," giving rise to invariants
 of smooth 4-dimensional manifolds. Organizer: Slava Krushkal


###### Fall 2020--Spring 2021 

**Anosov representations**  Organizer: Sara Maloni

###### Summmer--Fall 2020

**The Z-hat invariant and quantum modular forms** Studied the invariants of 3-manifolds recently introduced by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa based on 
ideas of supersymmetry in physics, and their relation to quantum invariants of 3-manifolds and to quantum modular forms. Organizer: Slava Krushkal


###### Summmer 2020

**Teichmueller geometry and Nielsen-Thurston Classification** Organizer: Sara Maloni

###### Spring 2020

**Heegaard Floer homology** Organizer: Thomas Mark

###### Fall 2019

**Floer Theory** <!--The first few weeks will be spent on chapters 1-4 of Audin and Damien's 
book _Morse Thery and Floer Homology_, which develop the construction of (cellular) homology of a manifold from a Morse function.
Subsequently students will independently learn about one or more versions of Floer homology: possibilities include continuing
in Audin-Damien to learn Hamiltonian Floer homology, related notions such as Floer homology for symplectomorphisms or for
Lagrangian intersections, or more diverse incarnations like symplectic homology, contact homology, instanton Floer homology,
monopole Floer homology, Heegaard Floer homology, and variations of these for knots in 3-dimensional manifolds.--> 
Organizer: Tom Mark.

**Lie Algebras in Homotopy Theory** <!--A main goal for the course is understanding Gijs Heuts’ preprint “Lie Algebras 
and Periodic Spaces”, also surveyed in his article “Lie algebra models for unstable homotopy theory”.
In brief, in 1969 Quillen showed that the rational homotopy of (simply connected) spaces could be modeled by 
differential graded Lie algebras over the rationals.   The new results say that the '$v_n$-periodic' homotopy of 
spaces can similarly be modeled by algebras over the Lie operad in '$v_n$ local spectra'.
A suggested 'Reading Course Schedule' is posted under Resources/Fall19ReadingSeminar on the topology seminar collab site,
and some key papers are also posted there.   If you are planning to come to this seminar (and this hopefully includes alg top 
students) please look at this!
I (Nick) am planning to give a two talk overview, but after that we need (student) volunteers!!  Let me know what you might wish
to talk (and thus learn) about; we can also do some planning at the first talk. -->
Organizers: Nick Kuhn and Julie Bergner
