<h1 class="mb-5">Geometry/Topology Conferences</h1>

##### Upcoming:

###### The Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar 

There will be a one day Mid-Atlantic Topology Seminar at University of Virginia on Saturday, October 26.
 
Speakers will be:
 
* Maria Basterra (University of New Hampshire)
* Mona Merling (University of Pennsylvania)
* Dylan Wilson (University of Chicago)
* W. Stephen Wilson (Johns Hopkins University)
 
All talks will be held in Clark Hall 107.
 
##### Schedule
 
9:30 – 10:30   W. Stephen Wilson (Johns Hopkins University)
Title:  $v_n$ torsion free H-spaces
Abstract:   For some years there have been $(k-1)$-connected irreducible H-spaces, $Y_k$, with no p-torsion 
in homology or homotopy.  All p-torsion free H-spacesa are products of these spaces and they show up regularly
in the literature.  Boardman and I have generalized theses spaces and theorems using $(k-1)$ connected H-spaces, 
$Y_k$, that have no $v_n$ torsion in homology or homotopy (to be defined).  These spaces seem ripe for exploitation 
in the environment of chromatic homotopy theory.

11:00--12:00  Mona Merling (University of Pennsylvania)
Title: TBA
Abstract: TBA
 
(lunch: 12-2)
 
2:00-3:00  Dylan Wilson (Harvard)
Title: Real Hochschild homology and the norm of $F_2$.
Abstract: We study a spectral sequence computing the homotopy fixed points of the $C_2$ action on the smash square
of $HF_2$. As an application, we give another proof of the $C_2$-Segal conjecture as well as a stronger, 'quantitative' 
variant. This is joint work with Jeremy Hahn.

This seminar is a regional conference
with a goal of bringing together the mid-Atlantic algebraic topology community.  It will also serve as 
one of the inaugural activities for the NSF RTG grant that the Topology and Geometry group at UVA recently received.
 
If you are planning to come, we encourage you to book accommodation early.  The seminar date falls in the midst 
of Charlottesville's annual 4 day film festival.  So one might combine attending the seminar talks and enjoying a film or two!  Information about this is here: http://virginiafilmfestival.org, though the film schedule only gets announced in mid September.  
 
Charlottesville is very pretty in October. Our restaurants will still have outdoor seating, and it is prime time for 
detouring through the nearby Blue Ridge mountains.  Using public transportation, we are accessible by plane (airport CHO) or 
train (e.g. two or three Amtrak trains each day from the northeast corridor).
